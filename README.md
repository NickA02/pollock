<h1>Project Pollock</h1>
Project Pollock is an abstract generator for papers. It was created for COMP590: Natural Language Processing @UNC-CH Spring 2023. It utilizes a Longformer Encoder-Decoder (LED) model to take in a body of text and output an informative abstract. The model was trained on data from the arXiv database.
model was the led-base-1638 variant, developed by AllenAI. 
<h1>Using the model</h1>
In order to interact with the model, please download Front_End.ipynb. Running the notebook will generate an intuitive Gradio interface which allows the user to interact with our model and generate abstracts for a supplied paper.
