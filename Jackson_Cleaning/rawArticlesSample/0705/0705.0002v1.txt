 ABSTRACT
 Context. HCOOH is one of the more common species in interstellar ices w ith abundances of 1â€“5% with respect to solid H 2O. With
 the launch of the Spitzer Space Telescope new infrared spect ra have become available of interstellar ices in di ï¬€erent environments.
 Sofar systematic laboratorystudies onHCOOH-containing i nterstellarice analogues are lacking.
 Aims.This study aims at characterizing the HCOOH spectral featur es in astrophysically relevant ice mixtures in order to inte rpret
 astronomical data.
 Methods. The ices are grown under high vacuum conditions and spectra a re recorded in transmission using a Fourier transform
 infraredspectrometer. Pure HCOOH ices deposited at 15 K and 145 K are studied, as well as binary and tertiarymixtures con taining
 H2O, CO, CO 2and CH 3OH. The mixture concentrations are varied from 50:50% to âˆ¼10:90% for HCOOH:H 2O. Binary mixtures of
 HCOOH:XandtertiarymixturesofHCOOH:H 2O:XwithX=CO,CO 2,andCH 3OH,arestudiedforconcentrations of âˆ¼10:90% and
 âˆ¼7:67:26%, respectively.
 Results.Pure HCOOH ice spectra show broad bands whichsplit around 12 0 K due to the conversion of a dimer toa chain-structure.
 Broad single component bands are found for mixtures with H 2O. Additional spectral components are present in mixtures w ith CO,
 CO2and CH 3OH. The resulting peak position, full width at half maximum a nd band strength depend strongly on ice structure,
 temperature, matrixconstituents andthe HCOOHconcentrat ion. Comparison ofthe solidHCOOH5.9,7.2, and8.1 Âµmfeatures with
 astronomical data toward the low mass source HH 46 and high ma ss source W 33A shows that spectra of binary mixtures do not
 reproduce the observed ice features. However, our tertiary mixtures especially with CH 3OH match the astronomical data very well.
 Thus interstellar HCOOH is most likely present in tertiary o r more complex mixtures with H 2O, CH 3OH and potentially also CO or
 CO2,providing constraints onitsformation.

 1. Introduction
 Formic acid is one of the few moleculesin star formingregion s
 that is detected both in the solid state and in the gas phase (s ee
 e.g., Schutteet al., 1999; Ikedaet al., 2001). Infrared obs erva-
 tionsoficesinhighmassYoungStellarObjects(YSOs)witht he
 Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) contain absorption featu res
 that are assigned to HCOOH and that correspond to the C =O
 stretch,Î½S(C=O),at5.9ÂµmandtheOHandCHbendingmodes,
 Î½B(OH) andÎ½B(CH) at 7.2Âµm (Schutteet al., 1997, 1999). The
 Î½S(C=O) band is the strongest spectral feature of HCOOH ice,
 but suï¬€ers from partial overlap with the OH bending mode of
 solid H 2O at 6Âµm,Î½B(OH). TheÎ½B(OH/CH) band at 7.2Âµm is
 signiï¬cantly weaker than the Î½S(C=O) band, but is present in a
 relatively clean region and has previously been detected to ward
 high mass star forming regions (Schutteet al., 1999). More r e-
 cently, these features have also been observed toward low ma ss
 YSOs and possibly toward background stars (Boogert et al. in
 prep.; Knezet al., 2005). Typical abundances of HCOOH vary
 between individual sources from 1 to 5% with respect to solid
 H2O.Theaimofthispaperistostudythe Î½S(C=O),Î½B(OH/CH)
 and other infrared features of HCOOH ices in di ï¬€erent astro-
 physically relevant laboratory matrices and to compare the re-
 sults with astronomical spectra to infer the chemical envir on-
 mentofHCOOH ininterstellarices.

 Ikedaet al., 2001; Bottinelli etal., 2007; Requena-Torres et al.,
 2006; Bisschopetal., 2007). HCOOH is part of the surface
 chemistry network leading to the formation of complex organ ic
 molecules seen in hot cores (Tielens&Charnley, 1997) and is
 therefore expected to be present in compact hot regions wher e
 it has evaporated from dust grains. In contrast, interferom etric
 observations show that gas phase HCOOH emission can be ex-
 tended beyond the hot core and is not coincident with other
 oxygen-bearing species such as CH 3OCHO (Liuet al., 2002;
 Hollisetal., 2003; Remijan&Hollis, 2006). The observed ga s
 phase HCOOH has low rotation temperatures and its abun-
 dance is a factor of 10âˆ’4lower than that of solid HCOOH
 (Bisschopet al., 2007). It is very likely that gaseous and so lid

 Previously,laboratoryicespectrahavebeenstudiedforpu re
 HCOOH and mixtures of HCOOH with H 2O and/or CH3OH
 by Schutteet al. (1999) and Hudson&Moore (1999). These
 studies only focused on speciï¬c spectral features. The data
 clearly showed that the morphology and composition of the
 ice matrix strongly inï¬‚uence the HCOOH infrared spectrum.

 Bahret al., 2005; Souda, 2006).
 There is a clear need to understand the spectroscopy of
 the main ice constituents such as HCOOH, as new observa-
 tional tools become available for the study of infrared feat ures
 of interstellar ices, such as the Spitzer Space Telescope, t he
 Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) ,
 and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Solid HCOOH

 2. Experimentalprocedure
 The experiments are performed in a high vacuum (HV) set-up
 with a base pressure of âˆ¼10âˆ’7Torr, that has been previously
 described in detail by Gerakineset al. (1995). A CsI window
 mountedinclosethermalcontactwithaclosedcycleHecryos tat
 is situated at the center of the chamber. It is used as a substr ate
 holder and can be cooled down to 14 K. The sample tempera-
 ture is controlled to better than Â±0.1 K using the cryostat cold
 ï¬nger, a resistive heating element and a Lakeshore 330 tempe r-
 ature control unit. The system temperature is monitored by t wo
 KP-type thermocouples (0.07% Au in Fe versus chromel), one
 mountedonthesubstratefaceandthesecondclosetotheheat er
 element. Ices are grown in situonto the substrate, by exposing
 the cold surface to a steady ï¬‚ow of gas that is introduced into
 the chamber via an all metal ï¬‚ow control valve with a modiï¬ed
 outlet directed at the substrate center along the surface no rmal.
 The ices are monitored by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR)
 absorption spectroscopy with 1 cmâˆ’1spectral resolution cover-
 ingthe4000â€“500cmâˆ’1range.
 To test the eï¬€ect of dilution of HCOOH (98% purity, J. T.
 Baker) by H 2O (deionized) four mixtures are prepared in a
 glass vacuum manifold. Both HCOOH and H 2O are further
 puriï¬ed by subsequently freezing and thawing the samples in
 the vacuum manifold. The mixture ratios range from the rel-
 ative abundances derived from observations of interstella r ices
 of 1 to 5% (see e.g., Gibbet al., 2004) to more HCOOH-rich
 ices with relative HCOOH:H 2O concentrations up to 50:50%.
 The astrophysical motivation for these higher mixture rati os is
 that other species such as CH 3OH are present in solid state
 environments with nearly equal amounts of H 2O and/or CO2
 (Ehrenfreundet al., 1998, 1999; Dartoiset al., 1999). The d if-
 ferent HCOOH:H 2O mixtures that are used here are summa-
 rized in Table 1. A pure H 2O sample is prepared for com-
 parison. Furthermore, some features of the solid CO band
 can be explained with mixtures or layers of CO with non-
 hydrogen-bondingmoleculesorwith hydrogen-bondingspec iesTable 1.Overview of ice morphologies, total ice exposure and

 other than H 2O (e.g., Tielenset al., 1991; Pontoppidanet al.,
 2003; Fraser et al., in prep.). Accordingly, we have also stu d-
 ied a set of binary mixtures of HCOOH:X and tertiary mix-
 tures of HCOOH:H 2O:X, where X stands for CO (99.997%pu-
 rity, Praxair), C18O2(97% purity, Praxair) or CH 3OH (99.9%
 purity, Janssen Chimica) are prepared with concentrations of
 âˆ¼10:90%andâˆ¼7:67:26%,respectively.Thesemixturesarecho-

 ice. Uncertainties on the concentrations of the ice constit uents
 areâˆ¼10%duetoinaccuraciesinthepressurereading.TheC18O2
 isotopologueis used to distinguish solid C18O2from regular at-
 mosphericgasphaseCO 2.
 A typical experiment starts with taking a background spec-
 trum at 15 K. Subsequently, the ices are deposited with a
 ï¬‚ow ofâˆ¼1.0Ã—10âˆ’5Torr sâˆ’1. An exposure of 1.0 Ã—10âˆ’6Torr sâˆ’1
 corresponds to 1 Langmuir (L) or equivalently 1 mono-
 layer (ML) sâˆ’1assuming that the molecular surface density is
 1015molecules cmâˆ’2and the sticking probability is 1 at 15 K.
 The deposition times and total exposures are summarized in
 Table 1. After deposition, FTIR spectra are taken at 15 K, and
 subsequently every 15 K for binary mixtures of HCOOH with
 H2O or CO 2and every 30 K for all other mixtures up until a
 temperatureof 165 K is reached. At each temperature,the sam -

 3. Datareductionand analysis
 The spectral range from 4000â€“500cmâˆ’1is very rich in absorp-
 tionfeaturesof complexorganicspecies,and HCOOH isno ex-
 ception. Consequently special care has to be taken in the dat a
 reduction.Dependingonthemixture,di ï¬€erentfrequencyranges
 areusedtoï¬tthirdorderpolynomialbaselines(seeTable2) .An
 additional local baseline is subtracted in the 1800â€“1100 cmâˆ’1
 frequency range. This is necessary as the HCOOH Î½S(C=O)
 mode aroundâˆ¼1700 cmâˆ’1(5.9Âµm) overlaps with the Î½B(OH)
 mode of H 2O at 1655 cmâˆ’1(6.0Âµm). This H 2O feature is
 much weaker than the HCOOH feature, even when only 10%
 of HCOOH is present, but it is responsible for a wing on the
 Î½S(C=O) band. Finally, a correctionis made on the Î½B(OH/CH)
 feature around 1390 cmâˆ’1(7.2Âµm) as it is close to a variableS.E.Bisschop et al.:Infraredspectroscopy of HCOOHininte rstellarice analogues 3

 The absolute band strengths are di ï¬ƒcult to calibrate in our
 experiment, because the number of molecules that stick to th e
 substrate sample is not exactly known. Instead, we focus in
 this paper on the relative band strengths that can be accurat ely
 measured. The relative values discussed here can be combine d
 withpreviouslymeasuredvaluesforthebandstrengthsavai lable
 from the literature (summarized in Table 3). The absolute ba nd
 strengthsforthevibrationalmodesdependonwhetherHCOOH
 is in the gas phase or solid state and consequently the number s
 inthetable donotperfectlymatch.
 To determine the relative band strengths, the Î½S(C=O),
 Î½B(OH/CH), andÎ½S(Câ€“O) features of HCOOH as well as the
 Î½B(OH) and libration ( Î½(lib)) bands of H 2O are integrated
 over the frequency ranges given in Table 4. The integra-
 tion boundaries for H 2O are identical to those used recently
 byÂ¨Obergetal. (2007). Since the Î½B(OH) band at 930 cmâˆ’1
 (10.8Âµm) and the OCO bending mode ( Î½B(OCO)) at 705 cmâˆ’1
 (14.2Âµm) of HCOOH overlap with the H 2OÎ½(lib) band at
 750cmâˆ’1(13.3Âµm), these two featuresare subtractedbeforein-

 I0(HCOOH) the integrated
 absorbance for pure HCOOH ice at 15 K. A similar formula
 is used for H 2O. The resulting relative band strengths arestudied as a function of temperature (see Sect. 5). An extens ive
 discussion of the uncertainties of the band strengths is giv en
 byÂ¨Obergetal. (2007). In short, the largest fraction of the
 uncertainties arises from inaccuracies on the mixing ratio of
 the ice and yields relative uncertainties that are below 10% .
 Additionally, baseline subtraction and deposition time in accu-
 racies are 1 to 2%. A conservative approach yields an overall
 uncertaintyofâˆ¼12%intheresultingcalculationsfortherelative
 band strengths. Furthermore, it is important to note that th e
 relative uncertainty between di ï¬€erent temperatures for a single
 experiment amounts to âˆ¼2% as only baseline inaccuracies
 contribute. Observed temperature trends are thus much more
 certainthanconcentrationdependencies.

 The following section summarizes the results for the pure an d
 mixed HCOOH ices at di ï¬€erent temperatures. All spectra are

 4.1. Pure HCOOH ices
 Clearly, the pure HCOOH ice spectrum shown in Fig. 1 for
 15 K is complex. For completeness we summarize the spec-
 troscopic assignments for all bands here (see Table 5), but i n
 this paper we mainly focus on the astrophysically relevant f ea-
 turesÎ½S(C=O),Î½B(OH/CH), as well asÎ½S(Câ€“O). The measured
 peakpositionsandFWHMsintheastrophysicallyrelevant18 00-
 1100 cmâˆ’1range are given in Table A.1 of the online material.
 The features at 3115 cmâˆ’1, 2754 cmâˆ’1, and 2582 cmâˆ’1(3.21â€“
 3.87Âµm) are all due to the OH stretching mode, Î½S(OH). The
 broad structure with di ï¬€erent maxima of these modes are as-
 signed to a combination of dimers and HCOOH organized in
 long chains (Cyriac&Pradeep, 2005). The Î½S(OH) bands over-
 lap with the 2953 cmâˆ’1CH stretch,Î½S(CH). In observations
 these bands overlap with and are dominated by the 3 Âµm H2O
 band.Theastrophysicallyimportant Î½S(C=O)bandhasits max-

 The temperature evolution of the astrophysically relevant
 HCOOH features in the 1800â€“1100 cmâˆ’1range is shown in
 Fig. 2a and the corresponding peak positions are given in
 Table A.1 of the online material. Most features are broad
 and consist of multiple components at 15 K. At 135 K the
 Î½S(C=O),Î½S(Câ€“O), andÎ½B(OH/CH) modes atâˆ¼1700, 1250,
 and 1390 cmâˆ’1split into two components. The splitting of the
 Î½S(C=O) andÎ½S(Câ€“O) bands is assigned to the out-of-phase
 and in-phase motions of di ï¬€erent HCOOH molecules within
 thesamechain(Cyriac&Pradeep,2005).Theout-of-phasemo -tions are located at higher wavenumbers than the in-phase mo -
 tions. TheÎ½S(OH) andÎ½S(CH) in-plane bending modes over-
 lap at 15 K, but are clearly observed as two separate peaks at
 higher temperatures. Our results are consistent with those of
 Cyriac&Pradeep (2005), who assigned the splitting to a con-
 versionofHCOOH dimerstoHCOOH organizedin chains,fol-
 lowingand experimentalstudy by Millikan& Pitzer (1958) an d

 In one experiment HCOOH is deposited at 145 K (see
 Fig. 2b). After deposition the spectrum is similar to that of
 HCOOH depositedat 15K and subsequentlyheatedto â‰¥135K.
 When the temperature is lowered to 15 K, the general featuresS.E.Bisschop et al.:Infraredspectroscopy of HCOOHininte rstellarice analogues 5

 theâˆ¼3000 cmâˆ’1range whereÎ½S(CH) is also located. Below

 CH bending mode Î½B(CH), the OH bending mode Î½B(OH) and
 OCO bending mode Î½B(OCO). Peak positions and labels are
 given in Table 5. In this study the focus is on the Î½S(C=O),

 remain similar to the high temperature spectrum. Upon subse -
 quent heating to 150 K an exact copy of the original (145 K)
 spectrum is obtained. Thus, the changes in ice matrix struct ure
 afterheatingareirreversible.
 4.2. HCOOH:H 2Oices
 Experiments with mixtures that range from 50:50% to 9:91%
 HCOOH:H 2O have been performed. In Figure 2c, the tempera-
 ture evolution of the mixture with 20% of HCOOH is shown.
 Peak positions and FWHMs for the 1800â€“1100 cmâˆ’1range
 are given in Table A.2 of the online material. The dilution of
 HCOOH in H 2O clearly aï¬€ects the band proï¬les of HCOOH.
 TheÎ½S(C=O) band shifts 3 cmâˆ’1to the red at 15 K and the
 Î½B(OH/CH) feature is narrower than in pure HCOOH. Between
 105 and 120 K both the peak intensity and FWHM of the
 Î½B(OH/CH) band increase. At 150 K the H 2O features change
 due to a phase transition from amorphous to crystalline H 2O
 ice structure. At the same time the Î½S(C=O),Î½B(OH/CH), and
 Î½S(Câ€“O) modes of HCOOH split into two components. Finally,
 at 165K allH 2OandmostHCOOH havedesorbed.
 Thespectrafordiï¬€erentmixtureconcentrationswithrespect
 to H2O are shown in Fig. 3 for 15 K (left) and 150 K (right).
 TheÎ½S(C=O) band has an additional component at 15 K in
 HCOOH:H 2O mixtures with high HCOOH concentrations that
 is located at lower wavenumbersand is due to the in-phase mo-
 tionbetweenHCOOHmoleculesinthesamechain.Thisimplies
 that there is a small fraction of HCOOH ice that is in a bulk
 HCOOH environment.The pure HCOOH componentdecreases

 At 150 K, theÎ½S(C=O),Î½B(OH/CH), andÎ½S(Câ€“O) modes

 line material summarize the proï¬le parameters.HCOOH mixed
 with H 2O results in a relatively simple spectrum, but mixtures
 withotherspecies,especiallyCOorCO 2,showmultiplecompo-
 nents. In mixtureswith CO or CO 2theÎ½S(C=O) band is shifted
 to higher wavenumbers of which the two most prominent fea-
 turesare located at 1717cmâˆ’1and 1735cmâˆ’1in both mixtures.
 Afeatureispresentat1154cmâˆ’1fortheÎ½S(Câ€“O)bandwhichis

 in the HCOOH:CO 2mixture. In CH 3OH, the absorption bands

 However, theÎ½S(C=O) andÎ½S(Câ€“O) modes are split into two
 componentsat1721cmâˆ’1and1691cmâˆ’1.TheÎ½B(OH/CH)band
 cannot be compared to that in the other mixtures as it overlap s

 ThetemperaturebehaviorofthespectralfeaturesofHCOOH
 ice depends strongly on the matrix species. In mixtures with
 H2O, the HCOOH bands are similar for all temperatures. This
 is not surprising as the H 2O ice structure does not change until
 135 K. HCOOH behaves di ï¬€erently in mixtures with CO and
 CO2at high temperatures, however. When CO has desorbed at
 45 K, theÎ½S(C=O) andÎ½S(Câ€“O) features are similar to pure
 HCOOH.Furthermore,itsintegratedintensitydoesnotdecr ease
 after CO desorption. In the mixture of HCOOH with CO 2, the
 1735 cmâˆ’1and 1717 cmâˆ’1bands of HCOOH only fully disap-
 pear between 75 K and 105 K at the same time that the features

 Prior to this study, only Schutteet al. (1999) and
 Hudson&Moore (1999) reported infrared spectra of HCOOH
 mixtures with H 2O and CH 3OH at 1 and 4 cmâˆ’1resolu-
 tion, respectively. Their experiments only focused on the
 Î½B(OH/CH) andÎ½S(Câ€“O) bands and consequently it is di ï¬ƒcult
 to make a full comparison with our data which also includes
 other HCOOH bands. The peak positions of the Î½B(OH/CH)
 features in pure HCOOH ice and 10:100% HCOOH:H 2O
 mixtures by Schutteet al. (1999) are shifted and the FWHMs
 are narrower compared to our data. However, the tertiary
 HCOOH:H 2O:CH3OH 8:66:26% mixture results agree very
 well within the experimental uncertainties. These discrep ancies
 are likely due to a di ï¬€erent baseline subtraction. In pure
 HCOOH and mixtures with H 2O theÎ½B(OH/CH) mode has a
 wing on the blue side, which is not subtracted in the present
 work. The peak position and FWHM for the Î½S(Câ€“O) feature

 5.1. HCOOH
 When HCOOH ice is mixed with H 2O the band strengths of
 HCOOH are strongly a ï¬€ected. In Figure 5 the relative bandstrengthsoftheÎ½S(C=O),Î½S(Câ€“O)andÎ½B(OH/CH)spectralfea-

 All mixtures with H 2O show a similar temperature trend
 as pure HCOOH. Even though between 135 and 150 K the

 A similar comparison for the relative band strength with re-
 spect to temperature is made for mixtures with CO, CO 2, and
 CH3OH(seeFig.6).ThebandstrengthsinmixtureswithCOare
 higher compared to those in pure HCOOH, even when all CO
 has evaporated. However, the band strengths in CO 2are close
 to or smaller than those for pure HCOOH. The Î½S(C=O) and
 Î½S(Câ€“O) modes are largest around 75â€“90 K, decrease between
 90â€“135K and ï¬nally increase again up to 150 K. The Î½S(C=O)8 S.E.Bisschop et al.:Infraredspectroscopy of HCOOHinint erstellarice analogues

 andÎ½S(Câ€“O) bands are relatively little a ï¬€ected in the mixtures
 withCH 3OH.
 The relative band strengths for the Î½B(OH/CH) mode in the
 tertiary mixtures are shown in Table 6 and those of the other
 bands in Table A.4 of the online material. Clearly, the band
 strength in the tertiary mixtures with H 2O and CO, CO 2or
 CH3OH areenhancedat 15K.
 In summary,the relative band strengths of the Î½S(C=O) and
 Î½S(Câ€“O) bands can range from 0.8â€“3 A0(HCOOH) and of the
 Î½B(OH/CH) band from 1â€“12 A0(HCOOH) in diï¬€erent ice envi-
 ronments.
 5.2. H2O
 Water absorptionbandsare strongly a ï¬€ected by the presence of
 other ice componentslike CO 2(Â¨Obergetal., 2007). In Figure 7
 therelativebandstrengthscomparedtopureH 2OoftheÎ½S(OH)
 and theÎ½(lib) modes in the mixtures with HCOOH are shown
 versus temperature. The Î½S(OH) band strength is signiï¬cantly
 smaller in all mixtures compared to that of pure H 2O, but does
 not dependon the mixing ratio. The Î½(lib) mode behavesdi ï¬€er-
 ently. It decreases as a functionof HCOOH concentration,wi th
 the smallest band strength for the highest HCOOH concentra-
 tions. As the temperatureincreases the relative bandstren gth of
 theÎ½(lib)bandincreases,untilatemperatureof135Kisreached .
 The diï¬€erent behavior ofÎ½S(OH) and theÎ½(lib) mode are fur-
 ther illustrated in the right panel of Fig. 7. For pure H 2O the
 absorbance ratio AÎ½S(OH)/AÎ½(lib)(the 3.0/13Âµm features) starts
 atâˆ¼7.5 and increases with temperature to 9.5. The mixtures
 have a higher ratio at 15 K, but decrease with temperature. Th e
 AÎ½S(OH)/AÎ½(lib)ratiofurthermoreincreaseswithHCOOHconcen-
 tration at 15 K. In conclusion, the ratio of the relative band

 6. Discussion
 In this section, our results are discussed in the light of rec ent
 chemical physics experiments of HCOOH-containing ices. Th e
 behavior of HCOOH in di ï¬€erent ices may lead to important
 clues regarding the behavior of the species under interstel lar
 conditions. Of particular relevance for interstellar chem istry is
 the mobility in the ice and desorption behavior of the ice con -
 stituentswithtemperature.
 The infrared spectrum of pure HCOOH distinguishes itself
 fromHCOOHmixturesbythepresenceofdimerstoachain-like
 structure of HCOOH molecules at 120â€“135 K for HCOOH de-
 posited on a KBr substrate at 15 K (see e.g., Cyriac&Pradeep,
 2005). The chain-structure at higher temperatures results in a
 spectrum in which the Î½S(C=O) andÎ½S(Câ€“O) bands are split.
 The transition from dimers to HCOOH-chains is irreversible as
 evidenced by the splitting of the Î½S(C=O) mode at 15 K for
 HCOOH depositedat 145K (seeFig.2andSect. 4.1).
 In binary mixtures with H 2O, the HCOOH ice spectral fea-
 tures remain relatively similar throughout a large tempera ture
 regime.Onlyfrom120Konwards,changesareobservedforour
 experiments (see Fig. 3). Initially, only the Î½B(OH/CH) mode
 increases in intensity and broadens, but between 135 K and
 150 K theÎ½S(C=O) band splits into the out-of-phase and in-
 phasemodesfor>10%HCOOH,similartowhatisobservedfor
 pure HCOOH ice. This implies that the molecules ï¬rst reorga-
 nizelocallyat120Kandsubsequentlybecomemobilethrough -
 out the ice at highertemperatures.Thisis corroboratedby s tud-
 ies of layered binary HCOOH-H 2O ices (Cyriac&Pradeep,
 2005; Borodinetal., 2005; Bahret al., 2005; Souda, 2006).
 In addition to the infrared experiments by Cyriac&Pradeep
 (2005), Metastable Impact Electron Spectroscopy (MIES) an d
 Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) have been used to
 probe the layered HCOOH /H2O ices. No mixing is observed in
 anyoftheseexperimentsupto120K.Furthermore,thesplitt ing
 of theÎ½S(C=O) mode between 135 K and 150 K in our experi-
 ments implies that H 2O and HCOOH segregate at high temper-
 atures.ThisisconsistentwithTPDdatafromBahret al.(200 5),S.E.Bisschop et al.:Infraredspectroscopy of HCOOHininte rstellarice analogues 9
 where HCOOH desorbs after H 2O, even in ices where H 2O has
 beendepositedontopofHCOOH.
 The interactions between HCOOH and CO, CO 2and
 CH3OH are diï¬€erent compared to H 2O. Very little has been
 published about either dimers or ice mixtures of these speci es.
 Parketal. (2002) performed experiments with HCOOH dis-
 solved in liquid CO 2and C2H6. The dimer/monomer ratio for
 HCOOH was higher in C 2H6than CO 2. This is due to the
 stronger electrostatic interactions of HCOOH with CO 2com-
 pared to C 2H6. A similar eï¬€ect may be responsible for the dif-
 ference between CO and CO 2as the monomeric HCOOH fea-
 tureat1154cmâˆ’1isstrongerinthemixturewithCO 2compared
 to CO. When HCOOH is diluted in an ice dominated by other
 molecules with no or very small dipole-moments like CH 4, N2
 and O2, a similar HCOOH ice spectrum is likely obtained. The
 monomer/dimer ratio will depend on the HCOOH concentra-
 tion as well as the strength of the electrostatic interactio n be-
 tween HCOOH and the other ice species. A similar behavior
 is observed for H 2O ice diluted in CO 2, CO, N 2and O2(e.g.,
 Â¨Obergetal., 2007; Bouwman et al., in prep.; Awad et al., in
 prep.).
 The CH 3OH spectrum is very little a ï¬€ected by HCOOH.
 This is probably due to a comparable strength of hydrogen
 bonds between HCOOH and CH 3OH. The infrared spectra of
 HCOOH:CH 3OH 10:90% mixtures shown in Fig. 4 clearly il-
 lustratethatbothspeciesdonotsegregateattemperatures below
 135K,evenwhenCH 3OHhasaphasetransition.Itislikelythat
 HCOOH and CH 3OH only become mobile between 135 K and
 150 K, as is found for mixtures of HCOOH with H 2O. Since
 CH3OHhasasmallerdipole-momentandfewerpossibilitiesfor
 making hydrogen-bonds compared to H 2O, it is also expected
 to segregate from, and desorb prior to, HCOOH. Other polar or
 hydrogen-bondingspecies such as NH 3and H2CO may interact
 withHCOOH anda ï¬€ectitsinfraredspectruminthesame way.
 7. Astrophysicalimplications
 7.1. HCOOH iceidentiï¬cation
 Formic acid ice has been observed in many di ï¬€erent astrophys-
 ical objects, such as high mass and low mass star-forming re-
 gions (e.g., Schutteetal., 1997, 1999; Boogert et al., in pr ep.).
 In this section we compare the laboratory spectra with the ob -
 served ISO spectrum toward the low mass YSO HH 46 and the
 highmassYSOW33A(Boogertetal.,2004;Gibbetal.,2000).
 The5.9Âµm (Î½S(C=O))7.2Âµm (Î½B(OH/CH))and8.1Âµm (Î½S(Câ€“
 O))bandsareusedtodeterminethetheiceenvironmentinwhi ch
 HCOOH is located. The 5.9 Âµm HCOOH feature is blended
 with other interstellar bands and the 8.1 Âµm band overlaps with
 the wing of a strong silicate feature. Nonetheless they can b e
 used to exclude some astrophysical HCOOH ice environments.

 mixturesare shown.Thesemixturescan clearlybe ruledout f or
 HH46becausethe Î½S(C=O)featureisshiftedtoofartotheblue.
 Similarly, pure high temperature HCOOH (Fig. 8b) can be dis-
 cardedas the out-of-phase Î½S(Câ€“O) modeat 8.1 Âµm band is not
 detected. Furthermore,for all pure ices and mixtures excep t the
 binary HCOOH:CH 3OH ice, theÎ½S(Câ€“O) band causes a small
 wing on the silicate band at 8.1 Âµm, which is not observed due
 tothemuchlargerintensityofthesilicate absorption.
 The integrated absorbance and peak position is determined
 most accurately from the Î½B(OH/CH) band, because it is theFig.9.Theobservedicespectruminthe7.10â€“7.35 Âµmrangeto-

 least blended feature of HCOOH. In Figure 9 the spectrum ob-
 served with ISO toward W 33A is shown for the Î½B(OH/CH)
 feature. The ISO data are chosen for comparison because they
 have higher spectral resolution ( Î»/âˆ†Î»â‰ˆ800, or 2 cmâˆ’1at
 7.2Âµm) than the Spitzer data ( Î»/âˆ†Î»â‰ˆ100, or 14 cmâˆ’1at
 7.2Âµm). In Figure 9a the 15 K spectra of pure HCOOH and
 20:80% HCOOH:H 2O are shown. Clearly, the pure HCOOH
 ice spectrum is too broad to ï¬t the astronomical feature. The
 Î½B(OH/CH) mode is also too far shifted to the blue for the
 HCOOH:H 2Omixture.ThetertiarymixturesdepictedinFig.9b
 match the observationsbetter. The HCOOH spectral features in
 the HCOOH:H 2O:CO and HCOOH:H 2O:CO2mixtures are al-
 most identical, but have a blue wing that is not observed for
 W33A.However,theHCOOH:H 2O:CH3OH6:68:26%mixture
 reproducestheobservedspectrumverywell.
 This sensitivity of peak position and FWHM of the
 Î½B(OH/CH) band at 7.2Âµm is further illustrated in Fig. 10,
 together with the observed values toward the high mass YSO
 W 33A. A Gaussian ï¬t is made to the observations in the same
 way as to the experimental data. The black horizontal line co r-
 responds to the ï¬tted peak position in the observations and
 the black vertical line to the ï¬tted FWHM. The dotted and
 dashed lines represent 2 cmâˆ’1and 1 cmâˆ’1error-bars for the
 FWHMandpeakposition,respectively.Clearly,thebinarym ix-
 tures with H 2O as well as pure HCOOH are too broad and
 shifted too far to the blue side compared to the observed fea-
 ture in W 33A. The tertiary mixtures provide better ï¬ts. The
 6:27:67% HCOOH:CO 2:H2O and 8:62:30% HCOOH:H 2O:CO
 mixtures have FWHMs that are too broad compared to the ob-
 servationswithintheiruncertainties.Furthermore,thei rpeakpo-
 sitions are shifted to 1386 cmâˆ’1, a few wavenumbers too high.
 Potentially, CO 2/CO:H2O ratios higher than 0.40-0.52:1 could
 shift theÎ½B(OH/CH) feature to lower wavenumbers and match
 the observations toward W 33A better. This is not unlikely as

 7.2. HCOOH iceformation
 The presence of HCOOH in a complex mixture dominated by
 H2O but also including CO, CO 2or CH3OH or a combination
 of these three species is not unlikely when potential format ion
 mechanism are evaluated. CO or CO 2are both potential pre-
 cursors to HCOOH and CH 3OH is known to form from CO
 through H-atom bombardment (Watanabeet al., 2004; Fuchs et
 al., in prep.). H-bombardment of CO or CO 2in mixtures with
 H2O (Fuchs et al., in prep.; Bisschop et al., in prep.) and UV-
 irradiationofCO:H 2O andCO 2:H2O mixtures(Watanabeet al.,
 2004; Watanabe&Kouchi, 2002; Gerakinesetal., 2000) donot
 give HCOOH as one of the main products. Since the UV ex-
 periments were performed under HV conditions, they need to
 be repeated under ultra high vacuum conditions to fully ex-
 clude this route. In H 2O:CO mixtures that are bombarded by
 0.8 MeV protons, to simulate cosmic rays, HCOOH is formed
 (Hudson&Moore, 1999).Itsformationisexplainedby:
 H+COâ†’HCO
 OH+HCOâ†’HCOOH
 where the H and OH result from H 2O dissociation in the ex-
 periment. In space, H-atoms from the gas phase can react with
 the adsorbed O to form OH. HCO is formed by H addition to
 CO, which will further react to H 2CO and ï¬nally to CH 3OH,unless HCO encounters an OH radical ï¬rst. Garrod&Herbst
 (2006) use this formation mechanism for HCOOH in the solid
 state. However,in their model HCOOH can onlyformat higher
 temperatures because the OH and HCO radicals are not mobile
 at low temperatures. This would be inconsistent with the det ec-
 tion of HCOOH ice in cold sources such as HH 46 and back-
 ground stars unless OH is produced with excess energy. This i s

 OH radicalsare notverymobile in bulk ice, but can movemore

 this reaction mechanism is expected to be strongly localize d at

 In this case successive H- and O-additionleads to HCOOH for-
 mation, and HCOOH may be produced at low ice temperatures
 at thesametime asH 2OandCH 3OHareformed.
 In summary, both reaction pathways make it likely that
 HCOOH is formed in an environment where H 2O and CH 3OH
 are located. Potentially CO, CO 2, and H 2CO are present in the
 iceaswell,ifconversiontoCH 3OHandHCOOHisincomplete.S.E.Bisschop et al.:Infraredspectroscopy of HCOOHininte rstellarice analogues 11

 The black lines indicate the peak position and FWHM of
 the observed feature and the dotted and dashed lines 2 cmâˆ’1
 uncertainties on the FWHM and 1 cmâˆ’1on the peak po-
 sition, respectively. Mixture ratios for all temperatures have
 the same symbol. The +symbols refer to pure HCOOH, âˆ—

 As discussed in Sect. 7.1 it is probable that H 2CO will have a
 similar eï¬€ect on the ice structure as CH 3OH and H 2O and thus
 also on the HCOOH infrared bands. In the future both reac-

 8. Summaryand conclusions
 Themainconclusionsderivedfromthisworkare:
 â€“The peak positions, FWHM and proï¬les of the Î½S(C=O),
 Î½B(OH/CH) andÎ½S(Câ€“O) bandsare strongly a ï¬€ected by the
 ice matrix. At high temperatures and when HCOOH is de-
 posited at high temperatures, the Î½S(C=O),Î½B(OH/CH) and
 Î½S(Câ€“O) modes split into two bands. In binary mixtures
 with H 2O, the HCOOH features have very simple proï¬les,
 whereasmultiplebandsarefoundinbinaryicemixtureswith
 CO, CO 2and CH 3OH. The peak positions of the HCOOH
 Î½S(C=O),Î½B(OH/CH), andÎ½S(Câ€“O) bands are shifted up to
 âˆ¼40 cmâˆ’1. The spectra for tertiary mixtures resemble the
 spectraofbinarymixtureswith H 2O,but smallshiftsexist.
 â€“The band strengths of the Î½S(C=O),Î½B(OH/CH), andÎ½S(Câ€“
 O) features are strongly a ï¬€ected by the ice structure. They
 are enhanced in mixtures of HCOOH with H 2O and CO by
 factorsof2â€“10,but aresimilar to thoseof pureHCOOH ice
 for binary mixtureswith CO 2and CH 3OH. Strongtempera-
 tureeï¬€ectsarealsoobserved.
