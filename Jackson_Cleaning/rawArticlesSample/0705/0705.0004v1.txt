 ABSTRACT
 We investigate the eï¬€ect of planetary rotation on the transi t spectrum of an
 extrasolar giant planet. During ingress and egress, absorp tion features arising
 from the planetâ€™s atmosphere are Doppler shifted by of order the planetâ€™s rota-
 tional velocity ( âˆ¼1âˆ’2 km sâˆ’1) relative to where they would be if the planet
 were not rotating. We show that, in the case of HD209458b, thi s shift should
 give rise to a small net centroid shift of âˆ¼60 cm sâˆ’1on the stellar absorption
 lines. Using a detailed model of the transmission spectrum d ue to a rotating star
 transited by a rotating planet with an isothermal atmospher e, we simulate the
 eï¬€ect of the planetâ€™s rotation on the shape of the spectral li nes, and in particular
 on the magnitude of their width and centroid shift. We then us e this simulation
 to determine the expected signalâ€“toâ€“noise ratio for distin guishing a rotating from
 a nonâ€“rotating planet, and asses how this S/N scales with var ious parameters of
 HD209458b. We ï¬nd that with a 6 m telescope, an equatorial rot ational velocity
 ofâˆ¼2 km sâˆ’1could be detected with a S/N âˆ¼5 by accumulating the signal over
 many transits over the course of several years. With a 30 m tel escope, the time
 required to make such a detection reduces to less than 2 month s.

 1. Introduction
 Since the early 1990s, more than 200 planets have been discov ered orbiting other stars.
 Roughly four ï¬fths of the planets that have been discovered a re at least half as massiveâ€“ 2 â€“
 as Jupiter, and about a quarter of the known planets orbit ext remely close to their par-
 ent star ( âˆ¼<0.1 AU). The Jupiterâ€“mass planets that are in close orbits are h ighly ir-
 radiated by their stars and are therefore called â€œHot Jupite rs.â€ Fourteen Hot Jupiters
 transit along the line of sight between Earth and their star ( Charbonneau et al. 2000;
 Henry et al. 2000; Konacki et al. 2003; Bouchy et al. 2004; Pon t et al. 2004; Konacki et al.
 2004, 2005; Udalski et al. 2002a,b,c, 2003, 2004; Alonso et a l. 2004; Bouchy et al. 2005b;
 McCullough et al. 2006; Oâ€™Donovan et al. 2006; Bakos et al. 20 06; Collier Cameron et al.
 2006). Observations of the transiting planets have conï¬rme d their similarity to Jupiter by
 revealing that these are gas giant planets, with radii compa rable to, or somewhat larger than
 Jupiterâ€™s (Charbonneau et al. 2000; Henry et al. 2000; Gaudi 2005).
 The eï¬€ects of the tidal torques experienced by an orbiting bo dy have been studied for
 a long time â€“ for an early seminal analyis, see Goldreich & Pea le (1966). Such torques tend
 to synchronize a satelliteâ€™s rotation rate to its orbital ra te, and if the torque is suï¬ƒcient
 this synchronization is achieved and the orbiter is said to b e â€œtidally locked,â€ as the Earthâ€™s
 Moon is. The Hot Jupiterâ€“class extrasolar planets are thoug ht to orbit suï¬ƒciently close to
 their stars that their tidal locking timescales are much sho rter than the ages of the planets.
 The planets, then, are expected to be tidally locked to the st ars, with one hemisphere in
 permanent day and the other in permanent night (Harrington e t al. 2006).
 A tidally locked Hot Jupiter will have a permanent sharp cont rast in temperature
 between the substellar point and the night side, which must h ave a profound inï¬‚uence
 on the atmospheric dynamics. Showman & Guillot (2002) make s imple predictions of the
 day/night temperature diï¬€erence ( âˆ¼500 K) and the speed of winds (up to âˆ¼2 km sâˆ’1),
 and their detailed, threeâ€“dimensional simulations agree w ith their estimates. Shallowâ€“water
 simulations by Cho et al. (2003) predict longitudinally ave raged zonal wind speeds of up to
 400 m sâˆ’1, with local winds approaching 2 .7 km sâˆ’1(under some assumtions). Simulations
 by Cooper & Showman (2005) predict a superâ€“rotational jet (i .e., blowing eastward, where
 north is deï¬ned by the rightâ€“hand rule) that blows the hottes t part of the planet down-
 stream by about 60â—¦from the substellar point. Their simulations predict super sonic winds
 exceeding 9 km sâˆ’1at high latitudes, high in the atmosphere (where the optical depth is
 low) and winds exceeding 4 km sâˆ’1at pressures near the photosphere.
 Transmission spectroscopy is a way to probe the atmospheres of these planets. Charbonneau et al.
 (2002) were the ï¬rst to detect an absorption feature in what i s probably the atmosphere of
 HD209458b, when they found that the eï¬€ective radius of the pl anet increases slightly at the
 wavelength of a strong sodium absorption doublet (the sodiu m D lines) at âˆ¼590 nm. In
 addition, Vidal-Madjar et al. (2003, 2004) have reported a n umber of absorption features in
 HD209458â€™s transit spectra that are due to various species ( including hydrogen Lyman al-
 pha, neutral carbon, oxygen, and sulfur, and some ionizatio n states of carbon, nitrogen, and
 silicon) in a hot exosphere that is probably only loosely bou nd to the planet. Intriguingly,
 through analyzing the red and nearâ€“IR portion of HD209458bâ€™ s transit spectrum Barmanâ€“ 3 â€“
 (2007) found a 10 Ïƒdetection of atmospheric water vapor. Several measurement s of the
 planetâ€™s emission spectrum, however, have found results th at seem to be inconsistent with
 high water abundance high in the atmosphere (Grillmair et al . 2007; Richardson et al. 2007;
 ?).
 Initial work by Seager & Sasselov (2000) and a comprehensive study by Brown (2001,
 hereafter B01) have described various other consideration s that should aï¬€ect the details
 of transit spectra, including the orbital motion of a planet (a few tens of kilometers per
 second in the radial direction), the rotation of the planet ( a few kilometers per second at
 the equator, according to the hypothesis that the planet is t idally locked), and winds on the
 planetâ€™s surface (in B01â€™s analysis, up to âˆ¼1 km sâˆ’1). These physical eï¬€ects should tend
 to broaden or impose Doppler shifts on absorption features d ue to the planetâ€™s atmosphere.
 B01 constructed an impressively detailed model of radiativ e transfer through a Hot Jupiterâ€™s
 atmosphere, assuming various models of zonal windï¬‚ow super imposed on an equatorial bulk
 rotation speed of veq= 2 km sâˆ’1, which is approximately the value for HD209458b under
 the assumption that it is tidally locked in its 3.5 day orbit. He ï¬nds the height of the cloud
 deck to be the most important parameter that aï¬€ects the trans mission of light through the
 planetâ€™s atmosphere.
 The original discovery of the roughly Jupiterâ€“mass planet i n a close, âˆ¼4 day orbit
 around 51 Pegasi (Mayor & Queloz 1995) prompted interest in t he dynamics and structure
 that must govern a highly insolated gas giant planet (Guillo t et al. 1996). Observations of
 the transiting Hot Jupiters heightened this interest when t hey revealed a puzzling feature
 of these planets: at least several of them are a bit puï¬ƒer than Jupiter, with diameters
 ranging from slightly larger than Jupiterâ€™s to as much as âˆ¼40% larger. It is not clear
 what provides the extra source of energy that allows some pla nets to maintain such large
 radii. It has been suggested that if a Jovian planet migrates very quickly, from its pre-
 sumed formation location at least several AU from its star, t o its eventual several day orbit,
 then it might reach its ï¬nal home before it has cooled enough t o shrink to Jupiterâ€™s ra-
 dius. Accordingly, some authors have investigated the migr ation processes that lead gas
 giant planets to such close orbits as have been found (e.g. Tr illing et al. 2002). Others
 have investigated various ways a gas giant could be reheated once it ends up near its star
 (Guillot & Showman 2002; Burrows et al. 2003; Laughlin et al. 2005; Bodenheimer et al.
 2003; Guillot 2005; Burrows et al. 2006; Chabrier & Baraï¬€e 20 07). Although various physi-
 cal mechanisms have been suggested as the apparently missin g energy source that allows the
 unexpectedly large radii sometimes seen, the lesson of thes e investigations in toto is that it
 is not easy to explain the inï¬‚ated sizes, either in terms of th e greater stellar ï¬‚ux that these
 planets experience by virtue of being so close to their stars , or in terms of their evolutionary
 migratory histories. A recent paper by Winn & Holman (2005) p ropose that, contrary to
 the commonly accepted paradigm, Hot Jupiters might be trapp ed in a Cassini state with
 large obliquity, in which the spinâ€“axis precesses in resona nce with the orbit, but lies nearly
 in the orbital plane. Such a state might be stable against per turbation, and yet able toâ€“ 4 â€“
 generate suï¬ƒcient internal energy to increase a gas giant pl anetâ€™s radius to the observed
 values. In light of an even more recent analysis by Levrard et al. (2007), however, it appears
 that the probability of capture into a Cassini state 2 resona nce is quite small for a planet
 with semiâ€“major axis a<0.1 AU. Furthermore, Fabrycky et al. (2007) argue that even if a
 planet is captured into Cassini state 2, it is likely to remai n there for a time that is short
 relative to the age of the system.
 Highâ€“resolution transit spectra that have high signalâ€“toâ€“ noise ratios will allow us to
 distinguish between various models of orbit, rotation, and weather, as discussed by B01.
 Because the orbit is known to high accuracy, and the predicti ons of the eï¬€ects of weather
 (or climate) are highly uncertain, as described above, we wi ll focus in this paper on the
 much more easily predicted eï¬€ect of a planetâ€™s rotation on a t ransitâ€“spectrum. If we neglect
 winds, then the largeâ€“obliquity Cassini state described by Winn & Holman (2005) should
 have a spectral signature that is very similar to that of a non â€“rotating model. In contrast,
 the rotation of a tidally locked planet should impose a Doppl er distortion that is roughly an
 overall redshift during ingress, as the planet is just enter ing the stellar disk, and a similar
 distortion that is roughly an overall blueshift during egre ss, as the planet is just exiting the
 disk. During midâ€“transit, the spectral distortion is more s imilar to rotational broadening. In
 the present investigation, we address whether there is any h ope that these spectral distortions
 from tidallyâ€“locked rotation can be observed.
 We ï¬nd that these shifts will be diï¬ƒcult to detect with curren t technology, but perhaps
 not insurmountably so, at least with technology that might b e available in the notâ€“toâ€“
 distant future. In a single transit, observations of HD2094 58 with a 6 m telescope that has a
 highâ€“resolution ( >50,000) optical spectrograph with good throughput ( âˆ¼18%) could only
 show the inï¬‚uence of tidally locked rotation at the âˆ¼0.2Ïƒlevel. With ultrahighâ€“resolution
 (âˆ¼>700,000) and good throughput ( âˆ¼4%) this eï¬€ect would still only show up at the âˆ¼0.6Ïƒ
 level. In less than a year, the signal of rotation could be pre sent at ï¬ve times the noise
 (S/N= 5). Of course, a telescope with larger collecting area, hig her spectral resolution,
 or better throughput would cause the signal to be apparent at that signiï¬cance level in less
 time.
 Other studies have approached the problem of determining th e rotation rate from a
 diï¬€erent angle. Seager & Hui (2002) and Barnes & Fortney (200 3) suggest that an oblate
 spheroid will have a diï¬€erent transit light curve from a perf ect sphere, and so measuring the
 oblateness from transit photometry will provide a handle on the rotation rate. The oblateness
 is somewhat degenerate with several other parameters that a re not perfectly known, however,
 so they conclude that it would be diï¬ƒcult to actually determi ne that rotation rate in this
 manner. The method we describe here could eventually prove t o be an important complement
 to other observations to constrain the rotation rate.
 In the remainder of this paper, we address this idea in detail . One complication that
 we discuss below is that the technique of this paper is not imm une from several nearâ€“â€“ 5 â€“
 degeneracies among the many attributes of transiting extra solar planets that inï¬‚uence light
 curves or spectra. Although it is likely that current or near â€“future instruments will be
 sensitive enough that the spectral distortion imposed by HD 209458bâ€™s rotation (if it is tidally
 locked) is visible, it might still be very challenging to dis cern the ï¬ngerprint of rotation from
 other attributes that aï¬€ect the spectra at a similar level. I n this paper, we tackle the
 forward problem of calculating the amount of distortion tha t is caused by rotation. The
 inverse problem â€“ determining from observations whether a p lanet is tidally locked â€“ is more
 diï¬ƒcult and should be the topic of a future study.
 The structure of the rest of this paper is as follows: In Â§2, we describe qualitatively what
 happens to the starlight received on Earth when a planet tran sits its star; we give a rough
 order of magnitude estimate of the the magnitude and detecta bility of the spectral distortions
 caused by tidally locked rotation; and we brieï¬‚y describe so me technological progress and
 remaining challenges relevant to our task of deducing bulk m otions in a planetâ€™s atmosphere
 from transit spectra. In Â§3, we describe our computational model of a transit spectrum . In
 Â§4, we describe the results of our model according to various a ssumed input parameters. In
 Â§5, we discuss the scaling of S/N on various model parameters a nd we address the prospects
 of actually observationally determining whether a transit ting planet is tidally locked. In Â§6,
 we conclude by describing various ways to boost our predicte d S/N to a more optimistic
 value.
 2. Overview of the Problem
 The practical feasibility of the investigation we undertak e depends on a few factors:
 understanding the various detailed processes that aï¬€ect th e starlight that reaches Earth
 when a planet transits its star; the magnitude of the distort ion that tidally locked rotation
 induces; and the technology available to measure such disto rtions. In this section, we give
 an overview of these three factors â€“ in particular, in Â§2.2, we give a simple estimate of the
 results that we will later (in Â§4) calculate in detail.
 2.1. Relevant Processes
 A planet transiting in front of its star aï¬€ects the starlight that ultimately reaches Earth
 in many ways. The motion of the planetâ€™s atmosphere (rotatio n and winds) is a small
 perturbation on top of several more dominant eï¬€ects. We ther efore summarize below the
 physical processes that are at least as signiï¬cant as the eï¬€e ct of tidally locked rotation.
 Figure 1 schematically represents this situation, and capt ures nearly all of the processes
 described below: a rotating planet (of exaggerated relativ e size) transits in front of a rotating
 star. The ï¬gure depicts a snapshot partway through ingress, when half of the planet is in frontâ€“ 6 â€“
 of the stellar disk1. The white circle indicates a hypothetical sharp demarcati on between
 the opaque part of the planet (in black) and the optically thi n part, labeled â€œAtmosphereâ€
 (described further below).

 arrows represent the rotation axes of the planet and the star , and the curved arrows indicate
 the direction of rotation for each. The Xâ€™s on the rightâ€“side s of both the planet and the
 star indicate regions that are receding from the observer an d are therefore redshifted; the
 unmarked left sides of the planet and the star are moving towa rd the observer and are
 therefore blueshifted. The white circle surrounding the op aque black part of the planet
 denotes the cloud deck, or the boundary between the partiall y transparent and the fully
 opaque portions of the planetâ€™s disk. The planet is orbiting in the same sense as both it
 and the star are rotating. The planet is shown above the starâ€™ s midplane to represent the
 inclination of the orbit relative to the lineâ€“ofâ€“sight.
 1.Geometric Occultation :
 The largest eï¬€ect is an overall dimming by a factor of roughly the ratio of the area of
 1The planet is above the starâ€™s equator to represent a slight i nclination in its orbit.â€“ 7 â€“
 the planet to that of the star: ( Rp/Râˆ—)2. Since stars are not perfectly uniform disks,
 but instead tend to darken toward the limb at most visible wav elengths, the fractional
 dimming due to being in the planetâ€™s shadow tends to be slight ly less than the ratio
 of the areas when the planet is near the edge of the stellar dis k and slightly more than
 this ratio when the planet is near the center.
 2.Stellar Wobble :
 The primary spectral eï¬€ect of the planet orbiting the star is the radial velocity wobble
 induced by the planetâ€™s gravity. This periodic spectral shi ft is of course in eï¬€ect during
 the transit, when, for a closeâ€“in planet like HD209458b, it h as an inï¬‚uence on the order
 ofâˆ¼ Â±10 m sâˆ’1. This eï¬€ect is a redshift as the planet begins to transit acro ss the disk
 (during ingress) and a blueshift during egress.
 3.Rossiterâ€“McLaughlin Eï¬€ect :
 A more subtle eï¬€ect arises because, during the transit, the p lanet moves across â€“ and
 therefore blocks â€“ parts of the star that have diï¬€erent reces sional velocities. If (as is
 expected) the planetâ€™s orbit is aligned with the starâ€™s spin , then during ingress the
 planet is blocking a part of the star that is slightly blueshi fted, and during egress it is
 blocking a part of the star that is slightly redshifted. Figu re 1 illustrates the planet
 blocking some of the bluest parts of the star during ingress.
 The parts of the star that are occluded during ingress/egres s have spectra that are
 blue/redshifted by a velocity that is approximately the equ atorial rotational speed of
 the star, or about âˆ¼1-2 km sâˆ’1for a Sunâ€“like star. As the ï¬gure indicates, during
 ingress/egress, the integrated spectrum of the remaining ( unblocked) parts of the star is
 on average slightly redder/bluer than it would be if the plan et were entirely transparent.
 Therefore, during ingress, the centroids of stellar lines a re shifted slightly to the red,
 and during egress the centroids are correspondingly shifte d to the blue.
 This soâ€“called Rossiterâ€“McLaughlin eï¬€ect (RME), describe d originally by Rossiter
 (1924) and McLaughlin (1924) in the case of eclipsing binary stars, adds to the shifts
 already caused by the radial velocity induced by the planetâ€™ s gravity, described in
 (2.) above. The RME has been described in depth more recently in the context of
 extrasolar planets by Ohta et al. (2005), GimÂ´ enez (2006), a nd Gaudi & Winn (2007).
 These centroidâ€“shifts are expected to be comparable in magn itude to the radial velocity
 wobble from the planetâ€™s gravity, and can be roughly estimat ed as
 |Î´vRâˆ’M| âˆ¼1 km sâˆ’1Ã—(Rp/Râˆ—)2âˆ¼10 m sâˆ’1,
 In fact, the amount of the shift can be predicted precisely fo r a given orientation of the
 planetâ€™s orbit, and so measuring the shift is tantamount to m easuring the alignment
 between the starâ€™s spin and the planetâ€™s orbit. Three years a go, Winn et al. (2005) ï¬rst
 found that the spin of HD209458 and the orbital plane of its pl anet are nearly aligned.
 The degree of alignment has been measured for two other syste ms â€“ Winn et al. (2006)â€“ 8 â€“
 found that the spin of HD189733 and its planet are also nearly aligned, and Narita et al.
 (2007) measured a misâ€“alignment between these two vectors b yâˆ¼(30Â±20)â—¦in the
 TrESâ€“1 system.
 4.Planetâ€™s Atmospheric Opacity :
 Furthermore, a gasâ€“giant planetâ€™s opacity surely does not h ave a perfectly sharp dis-
 continuity at an outer boundary, as a billiard ball does. Ins tead, it has an extended
 atmosphere in which the opacity must vary more or less smooth ly. There may be
 a cloud layer, below which the planet is entirely opaque to ta ngential rays and above
 which the opacity varies smoothly. Most critical to our inve stigation, at a given radius,
 the planetâ€™s opacity to tangential lines of sight must vary w ith wavelength, depending
 on the contents of its atmosphere. At wavelengths of strong a tomic or molecular tran-
 sitions, the planetâ€™s atmosphere will be more opaque than at other wavelengths. As a
 result, the eï¬€ective radius of the planet, or the radius at wh ich the optical depth along
 a tangential ray is of order unity, is greater at some wavelen gths than at others. These
 eï¬€ects have been described in detail by B01.
 5.Planetâ€™s Orbital Motion :
 The motion of the planetâ€™s atmosphere must inï¬‚uence the tran sit spectrum in several
 delicate ways. As B01 points out, there are three main mechan isms by which the
 motion of a planetâ€™s atmosphere relative to its star can aï¬€ec t the spectrum: the planetâ€™s
 orbital velocity along the lineâ€“ofâ€“sight, the planetâ€™s (po ssibly tidally locked) rotation,
 and winds in its atmosphere. The largest eï¬€ect of these three is the orbital velocity,
 which imposes a bulk blue/redshift during ingress/egress o fâˆ¼15 km sâˆ’1to spectral
 lines arising from the planetâ€™s atmosphere. These shifts ar e of opposite sign to the
 radial velocity wobble and to the shifts from the RME, and the refore tend to lessen
 the apparent RME slightly.
 6.Planetâ€™s Atmospheric Motion :
 The most dynamically interesting (and subtlest) eï¬€ects are those caused by the plane-
 tary rotational velocity and atmospheric winds. Since a tid ally locked planet rotates in
 the same sense as it orbits, the rotational velocity of its ou tside edge has the same sign
 as its orbital velocity, and the rotational velocity of its i nside edge has the opposite
 sign. As a result, during the beginning of ingress and the end of egress, when only the
 inside edge of the planet is over the star, tidally locked rot ation will impose a spec-
 tral distortion that is in the opposite sense of that caused b y the bulk orbital velocity
 described in (5.) above, and that is in the same sense as the RM E: the distortions
 are roughly equivalent to a relative redshift during ingres s (graphically represented in
 Figure 1) and a relative blueshift during egress. During mid â€“transit, with some parts
 of the rotating planetâ€™s atmosphere moving toward and other parts away from the star
 relative to an otherwise identical but nonâ€“rotating planet , the overall inï¬‚uence of the
 planetâ€™s rotation is approximately equivalent to rotation al broadening.â€“ 9 â€“
 Winds complicate the picture even further. It is likely that winds tend to rush from
 the substellar hot spot to the colder night side of the planet . With the substellar point
 on the opposite side of the planet from Earth during a transit , this corresponds to
 winds rushing toward us at several hundred to several thousa nd meters per second.
 This would tend to blueshift the spectrum throughout the tra nsit. Zonal wind bands,
 somewhat similar to those on Jupiter but with much higher spe eds, or other more
 detailed winds, can have an even more intricate eï¬€ect.
 Other interesting phenomena that primarily aï¬€ect a transit light curve, rather than
 the spectrum, include starâ€“spots (Silva 2003), atmospheri c lensing (Hui & Seager 2002),
 and ï¬niteâ€“speedâ€“ofâ€“light eï¬€ects (Loeb 2005). Although Win n & Holman (2005) describe
 a possible conï¬guration (Cassini state 2) that would produc e a spectral signature that is
 nearly identical to what would be expected from a nonâ€“rotati ng planet, the likelihood that
 any Hot Jupiters are in such a conï¬guration might be low, and i t seems quite likely that
 sometransiting planets are not in this state. Nonetheless, the m otion of a transiting planetâ€™s
 atmosphere â€“ rotational, wind, or other â€“ is clearly interes ting, and the basic technique that
 we describe below is applicable to any model of atmospheric m otion.
 2.2. Preview of Results
 A rough estimate of the velocityâ€“shift that is imposed durin g ingress to the centroids
 of the stellar Na Dâ€“lines by the planetâ€™s tidally locked rota tion (on top of the RME and the
 shift from the planetâ€™s orbital velocity, both of which woul d be present even if the planet
 were not rotating) is the following:

 is the ratio of the area of the portion of the planetâ€™s atmosph ere that is in front of the star
 halfway through ingress to the total area of the disk of the st ar. Based on this estimate,
 we expect a maximum velocity shift of Î´vâˆ¼190 cm sâˆ’1. If we take into account that
 HD209458bâ€™s orbit is actually slightly inclined relative t o the line of sight, the cosine average
 decreases to âˆ¼0.45, and the total estimate decreases to âˆ¼140 cm sâˆ’1. This estimate is in
 reasonably good agreement with the centroidâ€“shifts predic ted by the full model calculation
 below ( âˆ¼60 cm sâˆ’1); the diï¬€erence between the estimates is most likely due to t he diï¬€erence
 between the shapes of the stellar and planetary lines.
 We now estimate the signalâ€“toâ€“noise ratio for the detectabi lity of this eï¬€ect in an ob-
 servation of duration âˆ† t, with a telescope that has diameter Dand throughput eï¬ƒciency

 andD= 600 cm. For two identical absorption lines, we gain a factor of 21/2in S/N, and for
 egress we gain another factor of 21/2, giving a total oneâ€“transit S/N of roughly 4 .6Î·1/2, not
 counting the additional signal available during midâ€“trans it (see further discussion below).
 This S/N ratio is in principle independent of the spectral re solution of the spectrograph, for
 suï¬ƒciently high spectral resolution. For low spectral reso lution, however, the S/N could be
 lower than this estimate (below, we conclude that the S/N los es its dependence on resolving
 power for spectral resolution âˆ¼>500,000).
 There were several optimistic assumptions that went into th is estimate. Still, this rough
 estimate of the degree to which a planetâ€™s rotation inï¬‚uence s its transit spectrum indicates
 that the more inâ€“depth study that we perform below is warrant ed.

 2.3. Available Technology
 Detecting the centroidâ€“shifts caused by tidally locked rot ation ( âˆ¼<1 m sâˆ’1) will require
 very precise measurements of stellar transit spectra. Obta ining such high precision spectra
 will be quite challenging, for a number of reasons, several o f which were described in the
 groundbreaking paper by Butler et al. (1996) that analyzes t he limits of Doppler precision.
 Of particular concern, stellar pulsations and turbulent mo tions in stellar photospheres can
 cause small regions of the stellar disk to move at up to 300 m sâˆ’1(Dravins 1985; Ulrich
 1991). These motions tend to average out to produce stellar s pectra that are largely stable;
 but it is likely that at least some giant convection cells are not small relative to the size of
 a planet, and these could introduce a contaminating source o f noise when they are located
 behind the planet or its atmosphere. Butler et al. (1996) rev iewed what was then known
 about the variability of stellar lineâ€“proï¬les; the upshot i s that lineâ€“widths may vary by up
 to several meters per second over several years, but it is not clear to what extent spurious
 apparent velocity shifts may be induced by convection, and s uch stellar jitters may prove to
 be a signiï¬cant source of noise that would render it diï¬ƒcult t o measure sub meterâ€“perâ€“second
 velocityâ€“shifts. More recently, Bouchy et al. (2005a) have actually achieved sub meterâ€“perâ€“
 second accuracy with the HARPS instrument (spectral resolu tion of 115,000), and they
 have found a dispersion in nightâ€“averaged radial velocity m easurements for a particular star
 (HD160691) of âˆ¼0.4 cm sâˆ’1for nights when they took many ( âˆ¼>200) observations. Since
 in our situation (taking spectra during ingress, say) we hav e minutes, not hours, available,
 the rms scatter in ingressâ€“averaged radial velocity measur ements is likely to be larger than
 what they found. In addition to the diï¬ƒculties posed by sever al systematic sources of noise,
 achieving suï¬ƒcient photon statistics will be diï¬ƒcult for tw o reasons: for a given throughput
 eï¬ƒciencyÎ·, higher spectral resolution means fewer photons per bin; an dÎ·tends to decrease
 with increasing spectral resolution RS.
 By the midâ€“1990s, the timeless quest for highâ€“resolution sp ectrographs reached a mile-
 stone at the Angloâ€“Australian Telescope with the developme nt of UHRF and its resolving
 power of up to 1 ,000,000 (Diego et al. 1995). Despite impressive throughput rela tive to
 previous endeavors, however, its eï¬ƒciency was insuï¬ƒcient t o obtain the sub decameterâ€“perâ€“
 second Doppler precision on a Vâ‰¥7 star that would be required for planet searches. With a
 RS= 600,000 spectrograph built at Steward Observatory, Ge et al. (20 02) obtained stellar
 spectra with RSâˆ¼250,000 and throughput of 0.8%. Furthermore, they predicted tha t by op-
 timizing their technology they could increase the throughp ut to 4%. More recently, Ge et al.
 (2006) detected a new planet, around HD 102195, with the Exop lanet Tracker instrument
 at Kitt Peak. This instrument has resolution of RSâˆ¼60,000 and total throughput of 18%.
 Plans for a spectrograph that has resolving power of 120,000 on a thirty meter telescope
 (Tokunaga et al. 2006) give cause for optimism that increase d aperture area and eï¬ƒciency
 feeding high and ultrahighâ€“resolution spectrographs will , in coming years, provide accurate
 enough spectra that tidally locked rotation of HD209458b ha s a detectable inï¬‚uence.â€“ 13 â€“
 3. A Model of a Planetary Transit
 We consider the spectrum of a star whose companion planet tra nsits across the face
 of the stellar disk from Earthâ€™s perspective. The primary eï¬€ ect of the planet is to reduce
 the stellar ï¬‚ux at all wavelengths, but the planetâ€™s chemica l composition, internal structure,
 and rotation rate inï¬‚uence the spectrum in wavelengthâ€“depe ndent ways. Since each of these
 factors â€“ and others too, such as the starâ€™s rotation â€“ inï¬‚uen ces the observed spectrum, we
 built a model that incorporates the many parameters related to each process. The star and
 the planet are both assumed to rotate as solid bodies, with no other (nonthermal) motion in
 their atmospheres. Since deviations from pure solid body ro tation are likely to be no more
 than 25% over the disk of the star â€“ e.g., the Sunâ€™s equatorâ€“to â€“pole variation in rotation
 rate is about 21%, as per Howard et al. (1984), this is probabl y a reasonable assumption
 for the star. For the planet, this assumption might fail, bec ause windâ€“speeds in excess of
 the equatorial rotation speed of veqâ‰ˆ2 km sâˆ’1are predicted by many models, as described
 inÂ§1 above. Still, when making this initial study of the spectra l eï¬€ect of the motion of a
 transiting planetâ€™s atmosphere, separating rotation from other processes makes the problem
 more tractable. We set parameter values to match measured va lues from the HD209458b
 system where possible.
 The planet is modeled as an inner component that is entirely o paque and an outer
 component that is isothermal and drops oï¬€ exponentially. We compute the wavelengthâ€“
 dependent optical depth due to the sodium D-doublet at â‰ˆ590 nm in the planetâ€™s atmo-
 sphere; important parameters include the temperature and d ensity of the planetâ€™s atmosphere
 and its Naâ€“content. We use the Voigt proï¬le â€“ as described by, e.g., Press & Rybicki (1993)
 â€“ to calculate Ï„[Î»], the optical depth to absorption along the line of sight.
 As the planet transits the star, there are four points of â€œcon tactâ€ between the planet
 and the star (really between their projections on the sky): w hen the disk of the planet ï¬rst
 touches the disk of the star; when the planet is ï¬rst entirely over the stellar disk; when the
 planet is last entirely over the stellar disk; and when the pl anet last touches the stellar disk.
 We will additionally sometimes refer to â€œ1 .5thâ€ contact (halfâ€“way between ï¬rst and second
 contact), and analogously to â€œ2 .5thâ€ and â€œ3.5thâ€ contact.
 As described in Â§2 above, the type of distortion that a planetâ€™s rotation impo ses relative
 to a nonâ€“rotating planet changes depending on when during th e transit the observation is
 made. During ingress or egress, the rotation of a tidally loc ked planetâ€™s atmosphere will
 impose a distortion similar to an overall shift relative to a nonâ€“rotating planet: redshift
 during ingress; blueshift during egress. When the planet is in midâ€“transit, in the middle
 of the stellar disk, the overall distortion to the spectrum i mposed by its rotation is akin
 to a starâ€™s rotational broadening. Since the lineâ€“centers o f the lines we are considering are
 heavily saturated and therefore ï¬‚at at their cores, rotatio nal broadening has the somewhat
 counterintuitive eï¬€ect of steepening the cores of the proï¬l es while broadening the wings.â€“ 14 â€“
 We will discuss this in greater detail in the next section. Al though the type of distortion is
 diï¬€erent during ingress and egress from during midâ€“transit , it turns out that the amount of
 distortion, in terms of S/N ratio, is nearly constant throug hout transit. This, too, we will
 discuss in Â§4 below.
 We simulate the HD209458b system, with a 1 .32RJplanet in a 3.5 day orbit, orbit-
 ing a G0 star at with radius 1 .05RâŠ™that is 47 pc away. Our model star has the limb
 darkening proï¬le that Knutson et al. (2006) measured for HD2 09458. Our model planetâ€™s
 atmosphere has Naâ€“content and cloud deck height that are rou ghly consistent with the anal-
 ysis of Charbonneau et al. (2002) (metalicity that is 1% sola r). Finally, we present results at
 our simulationâ€™s spectral resolution ( RS= 700,000), and we simulate transit events observed
 using two diï¬€erent lower resolution spectrographs, one wit h spectral resolution Râ€²
 S= 50,000
 and one with Râ€²
 S= 150,000. All spectrographs (and associated optical paths) in ou r sim-
 ulations have 100% throughput eï¬ƒciency. In the remainder of this section, we provide a
 detailed description of our parameterization of the proble m.
 3.1. Parameters of the Star
 The parameters related to the star are listed in Table 1. They are set to match measured
 parameters for HD209458, and we use the limbâ€“darkening proï¬ le from Knutson et al. (2006).
 We normalize the ï¬‚ux to that of a blackbody of temperature Tâˆ—of the size and at the distance
 of HD209458.
 3.2. Parameters of the Planet
 The parameters related to the planet are in Table 2. We model t he planet as an inner
 component that is essentially a billiard ball (completely o paque at all wavelengths) and an
 outer component that is an isothermal atmosphere with scale heightH=RgasTp/Âµg, where
 Rgasis the gas constant, Âµis the molar mass, and gis the acceleration of gravity. The

 density of our model planetâ€™s atmosphere varies as Ï=Ï0exp[(râˆ’Rp0)/H], whereRp0
 is the radius of the optically thick part (some authors have c alled this radius the â€œcloudâ€“
 deckâ€ (Charbonneau et al. 2002)). This hypothetical cloud d eck could cause the planet to
 be optically thick at a higher altitude than would otherwise be expected, as discussed in,
 e.g., Richardson et al. (2003) and Sudarsky et al. (2000). Th e cloud deck causes the optical
 depth as a function of radius in our model to have a singular di scontinuity at radius Rp0.
 3.3. Spectral Parameters
 The parameters pertaining to the shape of the observed spect rum are in Table 3. In
 addition to the location of the planet within the stellar dis k, the shape of the stellar spectrum
 and the wavelengthâ€“dependent opacity of the planetâ€™s atmos phere together inï¬‚uence the
 transmission spectrum.
 SpecShape is a parameter that can take on the values â€œFlatâ€, â€œBlackbody â€, or â€œSolarâ€,
 and determines the restâ€“frame spectrum of the model stellar photosphere. (The integrated
 stellar spectrum is the convolution of the restâ€“frame spect rum with the stellar rotation
 proï¬le.) When â€œFlatâ€ is chosen, the restâ€“frame model stella r spectrum intensity is set to the
 mean value of the blackbody intensity in the speciï¬ed wavele ngth range [ Î»min,Î»max], which,
 in our simulation, is set to [580 nm ,600 nm]. When â€œSolarâ€ is chosen, the model stellar
 spectrum instensity is set to a highâ€“resolution solar spect rum that is normalized to the ï¬‚ux
 from HD2094583; but the Na D lines in this highâ€“resolution spectrum have bee n replaced
 by Gaussian ï¬ts to the solar lines.
 The planetâ€™s atmosphere has Nabsabsorption features, each of which is due to an element
 with a given fraction of the solar abundance. In the models pr esented in this paper, Nabs= 2:
 we consider the Na doublet at 588.9950 nm and 589.5924 nm, wit h sodium at fractional
 abundance fâŠ™â‰¡XNap/XNaâŠ™= 0.01 of the solar abundance. Each line is modeled as a
 Voigt proï¬le, as described in, e.g., Press & Rybicki (1993).
 3.4. Parameters of Observing and Computing
 The ï¬nal set of parameters, listed in Table 4, includes those that specify the observer
 and those that determine how the observation is discretized for the purpose of numerical
 computation. The model observational setup is determined b y three parameters: the tele-
 scopeâ€™s diameter D(6 m in our simulations) and eï¬ƒciency Î·(100%), and the spectrographâ€™s
 spectral resolution RS(we setRSto 700,000 for the purpose of computing the model, and

 The fractional solar abundance is set to 0.01 in order to achi eve modest agreement with data
 observed for the Na D doublet in HD209458bâ€™s atmosphere.â€“ 17 â€“
 we reâ€“bin to lower, more easily achieved resolutions â€“ 150,0 00 and 50,000 â€“ after computing
 a model). These three parameters prescribe the sizes of the s pectral bins and the rate at
 which those bins are capable of collecting light.
 In order to compute the ï¬‚ux at Earth as a function of wavelengt h, we begin by dividing
 the stellar disk into nbâˆ—concentric annuli, and we divide each annulus into nÏ†âˆ—azimuthal
 sections. In each section, the redshifted spectrum and the n ormalization must both be
 computed.
 Knowing the stellar rotation rate and axis, we may calculate the recessional velocity
 of any point on the starâ€™s surface as a function of its locatio n on the projected stellar disk,
 and we redshift the spectrum from each part of the star accord ingly. When the planet is
 inâ€“transit, we separate the stellar disk into an annulus tha t contains the planet and the rest
 of the disk that we treat as described above. The annulus that contains the planet is treated
 almost as above â€“ divided into nbâˆ—Asubâ€“annuli, each of which has nÏ†âˆ—Aazimuthal sections
 â€“ but the subâ€“annuli are incomplete, interrupted by the plan et.
 In order to sample the planetâ€™s atmosphere, we divide the reg ion that overlaps the
 star intonbpconcentric annuli around the planetâ€™s center, each of which is divided into nÏ†p
 azimuthal sections. In each section, we must determine the o ptical depth and multiply by
 exp (âˆ’Ï„). In calculating the optical depth, we note that in the case t hat the planetâ€™s rotation
 axis is entirely normal to the lineâ€“ofâ€“sight, if the planet r otates as a solid body then the
 radial component of its recessional velocity is constant al ong a ray:

 , (8)
 where the column density is calculated in terms of a function Gthat is speciï¬ed below:
 N[bp] =n0G[bp,Rp0,H]. In equation (8), vp[bp,Ï†p] is the recessional velocity of the planet,
 as a function of radius and azimuth, which depends upon the or bit and the rotation. Note
 that there is a single vpalong a given lineâ€“ofâ€“sight deï¬ned by a ( bp,Ï†p) pair only under the
 assumption of solid body rotation. The restâ€“frame crossâ€“se ctionÏƒ[Î»] is computed according

 4. Model Transit Spectra
 As described in Â§2.2, we seek the expected signalâ€“toâ€“noise ratio for disting uishing
 between the spectrum that would be observed due to a nonâ€“rota ting planet (or one that is is
 in a Cassini state with its rotation axis nearly in the plane o f orbit) and the spectrum thatâ€“ 18 â€“
 would be observed due to a tidally locked planet. The compute d model spectrum N[Î»] is
 the time integral of the instantaneous spectrum Ë™N[Î»] and consists of the number of photons
 detected per wavelength bin:
 N[Î»]â‰ˆË™N[Î»]âˆ†tobs,
 for some small exposure time âˆ† tobs.
 The model signal (of rotation) per bin that we are looking for is the diï¬€erence between
 the rotating model spectrum Nrotand the nonâ€“rotating model spectrum Nno rot:
 Sb=/parenleftBig
 Ë™Nrot[Î»]âˆ’Ë™Nno rot[Î»]/parenrightBig
 âˆ†tobs. (10)
 We make the optimistic approximation that the noise per bin i s just the photonâ€“noise:
 Nb=/radicalBig
 Ë™Nno rot[Î»]âˆ†tobs. (11)
 The total signalâ€“toâ€“noise ratio in a single exposure, then, is the sum in quadrature of Sb/Nb
 for all wavelength bins Î»i:

 âˆ†tobs. (12)
 A similar summation in quadrature applies over all exposure s. Note that, in principle,
 the expression in equation (12) is insensitive to the sizes o f bins and hence to the spectral
 resolutionRS, as long as the bins are small relative to the Gaussian width o f the absorption
 feature under consideration. Our simulations indicate tha t the spectral resolution must be
 âˆ¼>500,000 in order for S/N to be nearly independent of RS.
 The eï¬€ect of rotation, both during ingress and during midâ€“tr ansit, is illustrated in
 Figure 2. For illustrative purposes, in this ï¬gure we assume a uniform star (ï¬‚at spectrum,
 nonâ€“rotating, no limbâ€“darkening). On the left panels of Fig ure 2, we show a snapâ€“shot
 during ingress (at 1 .5thcontact) and on the right, we show a snapâ€“shot during the midd le
 of a transit (2 .5thcontact). The quantity plotted is Râ€²=R âˆ’1 from B01, where
 R[Î»,t] =Ë™Nin transit [Î»,t]

 The bottom panels of Figure 2 show the diï¬€erence spectra betw een the models with a tidally
 locked planet and the models with a nonâ€“rotating planet ( Rrotâˆ’ R no rot).
 As described in Â§2 above, a planetâ€™s rotation causes the centroids of stellar absorption
 features to shift relative to a nonâ€“rotating planet. In Figu re 3, centroid shifts (in velocity
 units) are plotted as a function of position in transit, for a planet transiting in front of a
 realistic star model with a Sunâ€“like spectrum. The recessio nal velocity increases roughlyâ€“ 19 â€“

 simulationâ€™s resolution) for a planet in front of a uniform s tar, and for a planet in front of a
 more realistic sunâ€“like star that rotates once per month, ha s a limbâ€“darkening proï¬le, and
 has a solar spectrum. It is apparent in the top panel of Figure 4 that a spectrograph with our
 simulationâ€™s resolution would see the eï¬€ect of rotation at S/N= 7.1Î·1/2in a single transit
 in the case of the simpliï¬ed uniform star, and at S/N= 3.2Î·1/2in one transit of the realistic
 star. The eï¬€ect of including in the simulation the realistic features of stellar rotation, limbâ€“
 darkening, and a solar spectrum is therefore to depress the S /N of the eï¬€ect of tidally locked
 rotation by a factor of slightly more than 2. The bottom panel of the ï¬gure indicates that
 our predicted S/N for one transit of a realistic star (3 .2Î·1/2) might be adjusted downward
 byâˆ¼50%, depending on the spectral resolution, indicating a tot al oneâ€“transit S/N for the
 case of the realistic star of about âˆ¼1.7Î·1/2. Finally, we do not show the incremental S/N for
 the realistic star model, but, as the top panel of the ï¬gure in dicates, a larger proportion ofâ€“ 21 â€“
 the total signal comes from ingress and egress in the realist ic star model than in the uniform
 star model.
 5. Discussion
 TheS/Nscales with the square root of the number of absorption lines under consider-
 ation, with the square root of the number of transits, and wit h several other parameters, as

 is a function that characterizes the (nonlinear) response o f S/N to the spectral resolution
 of the spectrograph; for instance, Ïˆ[700,000]â‰ˆ1,Ïˆ[150,000]âˆ¼0.6 andÏˆ[50,000]âˆ¼0.2.
 Finally, (S/N)0= 7.1 for a uniform star and XNap/XNaâŠ™= 0.01; and (S/N)0= 3.2 for a
 more realistic (rotating, limbâ€“darkened) star with a solar spectrum.
 Culling the signal from midâ€“transit, however, is much more d iï¬ƒcult than from ingress
 and egress, because the shape of the distortion depends more sensitively on the structure of
 the planet. For the realistic star, our model predicts S/Nâˆ¼1.3Î·1/2(with the 6 m telescope,
 with Poissonâ€“dominated photon noise) for ingress alone, an d therefore a factor 21/2greater,
 orS/Nâˆ¼1.8Î·1/2for ingress and egress.
 In Table 5, we present the number of orbits that must be observ ed in order to make a
 5Ïƒdetection of rotation, for various combinations of paramet ers. In all cases, we assume a
 realistically achievable optical setup, with spectral res olutionRâ€²

 Swill yield a modest improvement in S/N, and improvement
 inÎ·could be quite signiï¬cant. In the third column of Table 5 (A), we present the total
 available S/N for the whole transit, according to our model, while in the fourth column (B),
 we present the available S/N from just ingress and egress. Th e ï¬fth and sixth columns are
 based on the S/N in the fourth column.
 Finally, as a sanity check, our model can be tested by compari ng it to the analysis of
 Charbonneau et al. (2002). That analysis suggests that the s odium content of a planetâ€™s
 atmosphere can be determined by comparing the ï¬‚ux in a narrow band centered on theâ€“ 22 â€“

 6. Conclusion
 Our investigation indicates that, with currently availabl e instruments, it will be diï¬ƒcult
 to obtain the sensitivity needed to achieve a minimal S/Nâˆ¼>5 detection of tidally locked
 rotation of the planet HD209458b. Nevertheless, it appears that the eï¬€ect of rotation will
 have signiï¬cant (though small) inï¬‚uence on transitâ€“spectr a taken with current or nearâ€“future
 instruments. Because this inï¬‚uence is so small, it is worth c onsidering ways that the S/Nâ€“ 25 â€“
 could be improved, according to the scalings summarized in e quation (14).
 â€¢The most obvious way to boost S/N is to increase the collectin g area of the telescope,
 the eï¬€ect of which is shown in Table 5. With an extremely large (30 mâ€“class) tele-
 scope, the required discrimination power could be achieved inâˆ¼5âˆ’15 transits, if our
 optimistic assumptions about the noise are not too far oï¬€.
 â€¢As the abundances of other elements or molecules in the plane tâ€™s atmosphere are iden-
 tiï¬ed, the number of absorption lines Nabsthat can be utilized can increase. Observing
 four absorption features instead of two will boost the S/Nper orbit by 21/2and will
 therefore cut in half the required observing time to achieve a ï¬xed target S/N.
 â€¢The HD189733 system is only 19.3 pc away (Bouchy et al. 2005b) , but the star is
 smaller and dimmer than HD209458, and has the same apparent m agnitude. We ï¬nd
 that, overall, it has no relative advantage in terms of S/N. It may be unlikely that
 a star signiï¬cantly brighter than HD209458 will be found to h ave a transiting giant
 planet companion, but if this should happen the signature of rotation will be more
 readily apparent in the system with the brighter star.
 â€¢Finally, since S/N is proportional to the size of the atmosph ere, represented by Î´atmin
 equation (7), a planet with a more extended atmosphere would show the distortion due
 to rotation more readily. The size of the atmosphere depends on the product of Rpand
 the height of the atmosphere Î  atmâˆ¼15H, so the S/N could be increased in the case of
 a larger planet, a hotter one, or one with lower surface gravi ty. Unfortunately, although
 some other planets might be slightly larger, HD209458b is pr obably just about as hot
 and puï¬€y as can be hoped for.
 Although the optical transit spectrum of an extrasolar gian t planet contains many pre-
 cious clues regarding the nature of rotation and climate or w eather, we emphasize that we
 have so far addressed only the forward problem: deep, high sp ectral resolution transit spec-
 trawillbe distorted by HD209458bâ€™s tidally locked rotation, if ind eed it is tidally locked.
 But seeing the eï¬€ect of rotation in a spectrum and knowing that we are seeing the eï¬€ect of
 rotation are two very diï¬€erent things. The inverse problem â€“ identifying the rotation rate
 â€“ will be much more challenging, and is beyond the scope of thi s paperâ€™s investigation. In
 brief, it is impossible to decode the clues that the spectrum holds without a Rosetta stone
 â€“ namely, without already possessing accurate knowledge of abundances in the planetâ€™s at-
 mosphere. We note that when it comes to solving the inverse pr oblem, it may be possible to
 make do without a perfect Rosetta stone by comparing the star â€™s spectrum at two diï¬€erent
 times of transit instead of comparing it to an accurate input model. Speciï¬cally, comparing
 the ingress spectrum to the egress spectrum should eliminat e various systematic uncertain-
 ties that may eï¬€ect both ingress and egress spectra. This str ategy involves foregoing spectraâ€“ 26 â€“
 between second and third contacts, at a cost of a factor of âˆ¼2 inS/N, but has the ad-
 vantage of being more robust with respect to errors in modeli ng the planetary atmosphere.
 Furthermore, if detailed analysis along the lines of Charbo nneau et al. (2002) should reveal
 many more planetary absorption features, a large currentâ€“g eneration telescope could detect
 the motion of an extrasolar planetâ€™s atmosphere in of order a month.
 A ï¬nal point to keep in mind is that the technique presented in this paper is not limited
 to discerning the diï¬€erence between a tidally locked planet and a nonâ€“rotating planet; this
 technique can be used to investigate the applicability of an y model of the motion of a
 transiting planetâ€™s atmosphere. Some atmospheric circula tion models of Hot Jupiters predict
 extremely fast winds, up to âˆ¼9 km sâˆ’1, or more then four times the predicted equatorial
 rotation rate. It might therefore turn out to be easier to det ect winds than to detect rotation.
 Moreover, if an analysis similar to the one described here we re to ï¬nd a deviation from the
 hypothesis of tidally locked rotation, this would mean that something interesting is going on
 â€“ the planet could be rotating roughly as a solid body but at a d iï¬€erent rate; there could be
 signiï¬cant nonâ€“rotational motion in the atmosphere; or the re could be some combination of
 these phenomena.
