 Abstract
 We introduce a simple quantum mechanical model in which time and space are discrete and
 periodic. These features avoid the complications related t o continuous-spectrum operators and
 inï¬nite-norm states. The model provides a tool for discussi ng the probabilistic interpretation
 of generally-covariant quantum systems, without the confu sion generated by spurious inï¬nities.
 We use the model to illustrate the formalism of general-rela tivistic quantum mechanics, and to
 test the deï¬nition of multiple-event probability introduc ed in a companion paper. We consider a
 version of the model with unitary time-evolution and a versi on without unitary time-evolution.

 1 Introduction
 Fundamental physical systems may be governed by a Wheeler-D eWitt-like equation, rather than a
 SchrÂ¨ odinger equation. For such systems, the conventional probabilistic interpretation of quantum
 mechanics cannot be directly applied, and the formulation o f a consistent probabilistic interpretation
 is a controversial problem on which there is no consensus yet [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9, 10]. The
 complexity of this conceptual problem is increased by speciï¬c technical diï¬ƒculties related to the
 presence of continuous-spectrum operators, inï¬nite-norm states, gauge-groups having inï¬nite volume,
 and the like. These technical diï¬ƒculties can often be resolv ed by appropriate techniques, such as
 generalized states, Gelfand triples, group integration, a nd similar. But the technical diï¬ƒculties are
 often muddled with the core conceptual problem of making sen se of general-relativistic quantum
 mechanics, creating a confusing situation. In this paper, w e introduce a simple discrete model where
 all interesting operators are bounded and have discrete spe ctrum, so that many of these technical
 diï¬ƒculties do not appear. The model provides a tool for discu ssing the probabilistic interpretation
 of generally-covariant quantum systems, without getting e ntangled in the confusion generated by
 spurious inï¬nities and similar complications.
 We use the model for illustrating the general-relativistic formulation of quantum mechanics devel-
 oped in [5, 6] and in particular the prescription for computi ng multiple-event probability given in the
 companion paper [11]. In [11], we have argued that multi-eve nt probability can be always re-conducted
 to single-event probability, provided that the dynamics an d the quantum nature of physical measuring

 1apparatuses are taken into account. Here we use the discrete model for illustrating and testing this
 general technique for computing multiple-event probabili ties.
 We begin by introducing the model in the simpler context in wh ich there is unitary evolution in
 time (Sec. 2). We discuss its general-relativistic formula tion in Sec. 3. The probabilistic interpretation
 is discussed in in Sec. 4. The interesting â€œtimelessâ€ case, w here there is no unitary time-evolution is
 discussed in Sec. 5. The modiï¬cation to the formalism requir ed in the continuum case will be discussed
 elsewhere [12].
 As pointed out in [11], the formalism that we obtain shows an i ntriguing convergence with the
 Hartle-Halliwellâ€™s history formulation of quantum mechan ics [4]. This formulation of quantum theory
 has been largely motivated by the need of understanding the p robabilistic interpretation of quantum
 mechanics in the â€œtimelessâ€ context, and the problems has be en discussed in depth; see [13] and
 references therein. The conceptual diï¬€erence between the t wo approaches has been discussed in detail
 in [11].
 2 The model
 Consider a particle in a ï¬nite region of two-dimensional spa ce-time. For simplicity, assume that space
 and time are both periodic and the region has the topology of a torus. We shall later take the time
 period to inï¬nity. Discretize this region by means of a latti ce formed by N=NxÃ—Ntpoints. Denote
 the lattice points as s= (x,t), wherex= 1,2,...,Nxandt= 1,2,...,Nt. For convenience, we take x
 (respectively t) periodic modulo Nx(respectively Nt) that is, we identify x+Nxwithx, andt+Nt
 witht. We write the space-time quantum mechanical wave function o f the system in the form Ïˆ(x,t),
 where, we insist, xandtare here discrete, integer, variables.
 To begin with, assume the dynamics is given by a unitary evolu tion int. We drop this assumption
 below in Sec. 5. Thus assume for the moment that there is a unit aryNxÃ—Nxmatrix Uand the wave
 functionsÏˆ(x,t) that are consistent with the dynamics of the theory are thos e satisfying
 Ïˆ(x,t+ 1) = UÏˆ(x,t) =Nx/summationdisplay
 y=1UxyÏˆ(y,t). (1)
 This is a discrete version of the SchrÂ¨ odinger equation: we c an intuitively view the relation with a
 continuous theory as given by U âˆ¼eâˆ’iH0Ï„, whereH0is the conventional non-relativistic hamiltonian
 andÏ„is the lattice spacing in the time direction (we put /planckover2pi1= 1 throughout this work). In other
 words, Uis unitary-step time-evolution operator, that is, the the o perator that advance the state by
 one lattice step in the time direction. The full time-evolut ion operator is given by
 U(t) =Ut. (2)
 Its matrix elements
 W(xâ€²,tâ€²;x,t) =Uxâ€²x(tâ€²âˆ’t) (3)
 form the discrete analog of the propagator of the SchrÂ¨ oding er equation. We assume that UNt= 1 1,
 in order to respect the periodicity, a condition that disapp ears in the Ntâ†’ âˆž limit in which we
 are interested. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, Uxâ€²x(tâ€²âˆ’t) is interpreted as the probability
 amplitude of ï¬nding the system at the point xâ€²at timetâ€²if we have found the system at the point x
 at timet.
 One may also consider a variant of the model, in which Uxyis non-vanishing only if |xâˆ’y| â‰¤k,
 where, say, k= 1. This is typically the case when Uxyis obtained from the discretization of a
 SchrÂ¨ odinger equation, and derivative operators are discr etized by ï¬rst-neighborhood diï¬€erences. We
 call this version â€œmicro-localâ€, since it propagates at ï¬ni te speed on the lattice. (Recall, however,
 that the nonrelativistic SchrÂ¨ odinger equation propagate s at inï¬nite speed.) This micro-locality is in
 general inconsistent with the unitarity of U.
 23 General relativistic formalism
 We now illustrate the general-relativistic formulation of the model introduced above. The kinematical
 state space Kis the linear space formed by all complex functions Ïˆ(x,t), whether or not they satisfy
 eq. (1). More precisely, we deï¬ne Kas the Hilbert space K=CNxÃ—Ntspanned by the orthonormal
 basis|s/an}bracketri}ht=|x,t/an}bracketri}ht. We write Ïˆ(x,t) =/an}bracketle{tx,t|Ïˆ/an}bracketri}ht=Ïˆ(s) =/an}bracketle{ts|Ïˆ/an}bracketri}ht. The physical state space His the
 linear subspace of Kformed by the states that satisfy the dynamics, namely by the functionsÏˆ(x,t)
 that satisfy (1). Since these states are uniquely determine d by their value on any ï¬xed time slice
 t=constant , we have that H âˆ¼ CNx. Notice that, because of the simplicity of our model, His a
 proper subspace of K; this is not true in general (see chapter 5 of [6]).
 Let us give a more covariant looking form to (1). For this purp ose, let us introduce an NÃ—N
 matrix T(recallNis the total number of lattice points) whose only non-vanish ing matrix elements
 are
 Txâ€²tâ€²xt=Î´t+1
 tâ€²Uxâ€²x. (4)
 Notice that Tis unitary and
 TNt= 1 1 (5)
 (here 1 1 is the unity operator over K). Then we can write the dynamical law (1) in the covariant for m
 TÏˆ=Ïˆ, that is
 N/summationdisplay
 s=1Tsâ€²sÏˆ(s) =Ïˆ(sâ€²). (6)
 This is the discrete analog of the continuous Wheeler-DeWit t equation (see [11]). In other words, we
 can intuitively view the relation with the continuous theor y as given by T âˆ¼eâˆ’iHÏ„âˆ¼eâˆ’i(pt+H0)Ï„,
 whereHis the relativistic hamiltonian [6], or â€œhamiltonian const raintâ€ andÏ„is a small parameter-time
 step.
 The generalized projector Pthat deï¬nes the relativistic formalism is deï¬ned by
 P=/summationdisplay
 nTn, (7)
 where, because of the periodicity Tn+Nt=Tn, in (7) we sum only over n= 1,...,Nt. The deï¬nition
 (7) can be seen as the discrete version of the expression
 P=/integraldisplay
 dÏ„ eâˆ’iÏ„(pt+H0), (8)
 which deï¬nes the generalized projector in the continuous ca se (see eq. (5.58) of [6] and eq. (5) of [11].
 This expression is also related to the â€œgroup averagingâ€ tec hnique, see [14]).
 It is easy to check that PisNttimes the projector operator ËœP:K â†’ H . In fact, if Ïˆis inH,
 namely satisï¬es (6), we have immediately PÏˆ=NtÏˆ. On the other hand, since Tis unitary, it is
 diagonalizable and its eigenvalues have the form eiÎ±. The physical Hilbert space His given by the
 eigenspace associate with the eigenvalue Î±= 0: Because of the periodicity (5), NtÎ±= 2Ï€Ifor some
 integerI. Acting on the corresponding eigenstate, Î¦ Î±

 It is important to notice that while the projector ËœPis ill-deï¬ned in the Ntâ†’ âˆž limit, the
 generalized projector Premains well deï¬ned. It is for this reason that Premains meaningful also
 when Hfails to be a proper subspace of K. A straightforward calculation shows also that
 /an}bracketle{txâ€²,tâ€²|P|x,t/an}bracketri}ht= (U(tâ€²âˆ’t))xâ€²x= (U(tâ€²âˆ’t))xâ€²x=Uxâ€²x(tâ€²âˆ’t); (10)
 3that is: the matrix elements of Pare the matrix elements of the evolution operator or, what is the
 same, the propagator (cf. eq. (3)).
 Notice that we can write
 /an}bracketle{txâ€²,tâ€²|P|x,t/an}bracketri}ht= (U(tâ€²âˆ’t))xâ€²x=/summationdisplay
 x1...xtâ€²âˆ’tâˆ’1Uxâ€²x1Ux1x2Â·Â·Â·Uxtâ€²âˆ’tâˆ’1xâ‰¡/summationdisplay
 Î³(x,t)â‡’(xâ€²,tâ€²)U[Î³], (11)
 where the sum is over all the â€œhistoriesâ€ (sequences of latti ce points)Î³={(x1,t),(x2,t+1),....,(xâ€²,tâ€²)}
 that start at the point ( x,t), increase monotonically in time by one time unit at every st ep, and end
 at the point ( xâ€²,tâ€²). This expression illustrates the connection with the sum- over-history formalism
 (see [4] and references therein). It is important to observe that we can equivalently write
 /an}bracketle{tsâ€²|P|s/an}bracketri}ht=/summationdisplay
 s,s1,s2,...,s nTss1Ts1s2Â·Â·Â·Tsnsâ€²â‰¡/summationdisplay
 Î³sâ‡’sâ€²U[Î³], (12)
 where now the sum can be extended over allpossible histories. In fact, because of the form (4) of the
 matrix T, the only histories that have nonvanishing amplitude are th e ones that increase monotonically
 in time by one time unit at every step. Using this language, th e fact that the histories summed over
 increase monotonically in tis not an intrinsic property of the formalism, but only a prop erty of the
 matrix Tsâ€²s. This is the property that we will drop in Sec. 5.
 This history language becomes particularly transparent in the micro-local case, in which the trans-
 fer matrix Uis directly given by a (non-unitary) discretization of the S chrÂ¨ odinger equation. Say, for
 instance, that H0=1
 2mp2+V(x), then, approximating the derivative with ï¬nite diï¬€erence s, we write
 the SchrÂ¨ odinger equation (1) in the form
 Ïˆ(x,t+ 1) =Î±Ïˆ(x+ 1,t) +Î±Ïˆ(xâˆ’1,t) +Î²(x)Ïˆ(x,t) (13)
 (ifaandÏ„are the spatial and temporal the lattice-spaces, Î±=i/planckover2pi1Ï„

 ).
 Then the only non-vanishing matrix elements of the Tmatrix are
 Txâ€²tâ€²xt=Î´t+1

 Î±(Î´x+1

 . (14)
 That is, Thas nonâ€“vanishing elements only for histories that are â€œcon tinuousâ€ on the lattice, namely
 formed by sequences of adjacent (or diagonal) lattice sites .
 Let us now come to an important point. For the moment, we have i ntroduced Has a linear
 space, without saying anything about its Hilbert-space str ucture, namely about its scalar product.
 As a proper subspace of K, the space Hinherits a scalar product from K. However, it is far more
 convenient to deï¬ne a diï¬€erent scalar product in H, deï¬ned as the scalar product in K,divided byNt.
 That is, ifÏˆ,Ïˆâ€²âˆˆ H, we deï¬ne
 /an}bracketle{tÏˆâ€²|Ïˆ/an}bracketri}htHâ‰¡1
 Nt/an}bracketle{tÏˆâ€²|Ïˆ/an}bracketri}htK. (15)
 This deï¬nition follows easily from the general deï¬nition of the scalar product of a physical space (eq.
 (5.64) and following lines in [6], and eq. (4) in [11])
 /an}bracketle{tsâ€²|s/an}bracketri}htHâ‰¡ /an}bracketle{tPsâ€²|Ps/an}bracketri}htHâ‰¡ /an}bracketle{tsâ€²|P|s/an}bracketri}htK. (16)
 Thus, we promote Hto an Hilbert space by deï¬ning its scalar product by (15). The advantage of
 this, of course, is that in the limit Ntâ†’ âˆž the scalar product /an}bracketle{t | /an}bracketri}htHremains well deï¬ned. In other
 words, this Hilbert structure is well deï¬ned even when His not a proper subspace of K. Notice that
 it follows from this deï¬nition that |x,t/an}bracketri}htis a normalized vector in Kand also P|x,t/an}bracketri}htis a normalized
 vector in H.
 From now on, we take Ntâ†’ âˆž. We interpret this limit as describing the inï¬nite time evol ution,
 not the continuous limit of the lattice spacing.
 44 Probabilistic interpretation
 According to the basic postulate of relativistic quantum me chanics [6], states in Krepresent possible
 observations. In particular, the state |x,t/an}bracketri}ht âˆˆ K represents the event ( x,t) in spacetime: say â€œthe
 particle is detected by an apparatusâ€ at the spacetime point (x,t). Then (see eqs. (5.59)-(5.60) in
 [6], or eq. (7) in [11]) the probability amplitude for observ ing the event ( xâ€²,tâ€²) if the event ( x,t) was
 detected, is given by
 A(x,t)â‡’(xâ€²,tâ€²)=/an}bracketle{txâ€²,tâ€²|P|x,t/an}bracketri}ht. (17)
 By equations (3) and (10), this is the conventional amplitud e of standard quantum mechanics, that
 is, the propagator. The interest of this formulation, on the other hand, is that it remains meaningful
 and well deï¬ned when the dynamics is not unitary in time.
 The above deï¬nition of probability amplitude is suï¬ƒcient to deï¬ne the probability of single events,
 described by individual states in K. The problem left open in [6], and addressed in [11], was to de ï¬ne
 the probability for multiple events, or for a subspace of Kwith dimension larger than 1. This cannot
 be avoided, in particular, when dealing with operators with continuous spectrum, because physical
 apparatuses have always ï¬nite resolution and therefore in g eneral cannot detect individual events. Let
 us therefore move to multiple-event probabilities.
 A case that does not raise diï¬ƒculties is to deï¬ne the probabil ity that the particle be detected at
 (x,t) OR (y,t), wherex/ne}ationslash=y, but, notice, the tof the two events is the same. In this case, the two
 events are orthogonal in H, because
 /an}bracketle{ty,t|P|x,t/an}bracketri}ht= (U(0))yx=Î´yx. (18)
 We are therefore in the simple case (i) of Sec. III of [11], whe re, following [11], we postulate that
 probabilities add. This is of course nothing but the standar d assumptions in non-relativistic quantum
 mechanics demanding that the probability of being at any one of two diï¬€erent points at the same
 timeis the sum of the two probabilities of being at the individual points. Let us move on to the more
 interesting case.
 What is the probability that the particle be detected at ( y,t1) OR (y,t2), where, say, t1< t2?
 For simplicity, let us focus, instead, on the probability fo r the particle to be detected in ( y,t1) AND
 (y,t2); the two are easily related (see eq. (14) in [11]). Now we hav e
 /an}bracketle{ty,t2|P|y,t1/an}bracketri}ht=Uyy(t2âˆ’t1) (19)
 which in general does not vanish. This is case (ii) of Sec. III of [11]. According to [11], this probability
 can be given a physical meaning onlyby explicitly coupling the system to an apparatus that inter acts
 with the system at time t1at the point y, namely at the space-time point s1= (y,t1). Let us therefore
 do so.
 We model the apparatus in the simplest possible form. Introd uce a two-state system |A/an}bracketri}htwith
 A=Yes,No , and couple it to our system. The kinematical state of the com bined system is Kext=
 CNxÃ—NtâŠ—C2, spanned by the orthonormal basis |Ïƒ/an}bracketri}ht=|x,t,A /an}bracketri}ht=|s,A/an}bracketri}ht. We deï¬ne the dynamics by
 replacing the operator Twith the operator Ts1=Tx1t1deï¬ned by
 (Ts1)Ïƒâ€²Ïƒ=Tsâ€²Aâ€²sA=Tsâ€²sÎ´A
 Aâ€²+Î´s
 s1Tsâ€²s(IAâ€²Aâˆ’Î´A
 Aâ€²). (20)
 The ï¬rst term is the free evolution of the system and the free ( trivial) evolution of the apparatus.
 The second term is the interaction. It is diï¬€erent from zero o nly at the space-time point s1= (x1,t1),
 that is, the apparatus ï¬‚ips, if and only if the particle pass t hroughx=x1at timet=t1. Here, the
 evolution of the apparatus is given, instead than the trivia l evolution operator Î´A
 Aâ€², by the matrix
 IAâ€²Aâ‰¡/parenleftbigg
 0 1
 1 0/parenrightbigg
 , (21)
 5which ï¬‚ips the state of the apparatus. We call Ps1=Px1,t1the generalized propagator deï¬ned by this
 coupling, namely by inserting the operator Tx1t1deï¬ned in (20) into (12). That is
 /an}bracketle{tsâ€²|Ps1|s/an}bracketri}ht=/summationdisplay

 Î³sâ‡’sâ€²Us1[Î³]. (22)
 It is easy to see that this implies
 /an}bracketle{txâ€²,tâ€²,Aâ€²|Px1,t1|x,t,A /an}bracketri}ht=Uxâ€²x(tâ€²âˆ’t)Î´Aâ€²A (23)

 particle is at x1at timet1. Using (11), this can be rewritten in a more covariant lookin g form

 (25)
 whereÎ´Î³
 (x1,t1)= 1 if the history goes through x1,t1andÎ´Î³
 (x1,t1)= 0 otherwise.
 The multiple probability amplitude is then given by (accord ing to Sec. IV.C of [11])
 A(x,t)â‡’((x1,t1),(xâ€²,tâ€²))=/an}bracketle{txâ€²,tâ€²,Yes|Px1,t1|x,t,No /an}bracketri}ht. (26)
 A straightforward computation gives the probability (eq. ( 10) of [11])
 P(x,t)â‡’((x1,t1),(xâ€²,tâ€²))=|A(x,t)â‡’((x1,t1),(xâ€²,tâ€²))|2=|Uxâ€²x1(tâ€²âˆ’t1)|2|Ux1x(t1âˆ’t)|2. (27)
 The reader can check with a tedious but straightforward calc ulation, using standard quantum me-
 chanics and the wave function collapse algorithm, that this is the correct probability for this sequence
 of measurements, namely for detecting the particle at xâ€²at timetâ€²andatx1at timet1if the particle
 was initially at xat timet(assumingt<t 1<tâ€²).
 The coupling to an apparatus can be easily generalized to an a rbitrary number of apparatuses.
 For instance, say we have apparatuses at the space-time poin tss1,...,sKcoupled as follows
 Tsâ€²Aâ€²
 1...Aâ€²

 Then the probability to observe the system at the space-time point (xâ€²,tâ€²) in conjunction with all
 apparatuses having detected the particle at all the events s1,s2,...,sK, if the system was observed
 at the space-time point ( x,t) in conjunction with all apparatuses being in the Nostate is

 The possibility of taking the continuum limit of this expres sion will be discussed in [12]. Again, the
 reader can check that this is the correct probability for a se quence of measurements, where the wave
 function is repeatedly collapsed at each measurement.
 What we have done so far, indeed, is nothing more than a reform ulation of the standard proba-
 bilistic interpretation of quantum theory, including the p robabilities computed by using the collapse
 postulate. What is interesting is that thisformulation can be readily generalized to the case where
 there is no unitary evolution, and therefore no evident time -ordering in the system. In fact, the reader
 6should notice that the expression (29) does not depend explicitly on the time-ordering of the mea-
 surements. Time-ordering is implicitly implemented by the dynamics of the coupled system, which is
 coded into the form of T. In other words, if s2is earlier in time than s1, then the probability (29)
 becomes automatically the one given by ï¬rst projecting on s2and then on s1. This is particularly
 transparent in the history language: the histories summed o ver are only the ones correctly ordered in
 timebecause the dynamical operator Tselects only these histories. In this sense, in this formalism the
 time ordering of the measurements is absorbed into the deï¬ni tion of the dynamics. It is this fact that
 allows us to generalize the formalism to a genuinely â€œtimele ssâ€ situation, namely a situation in which
 the dynamics is not given by unitary evolution in t. This is what we do in the following section.
 5 Extension to the timeless case
 We now consider the extension of the discrete model to the cas e where there is nounitary evolution in
 time. We take the same kinematics as the discrete dynamics ab ove, but a diï¬€erent dynamics. That is,
 we take again a lattice with lattice points s= (x,t), but now there will not be a unitary evolution in
 t. The kinematical Hilbert space is always spanned by the orth onormal basis |s/an}bracketri}ht=|x,t/an}bracketri}ht, and we still
 deï¬ne the quantum dynamics by the discrete Wheeler-DeWitt e quation (6) and by the generalized
 projector (7).
 The novelty is that now we do not assume Tto have the form (4). This form, in fact, is the
 discrete analog of H=pt+H0, which deï¬nes the non-relativistic special case of general ized quantum
 mechanics.
 A particularly interesting case is given when Tis still micro-local, that is, has non-vanishing matrix
 elements Tsâ€²sonly for lattice points s= (x,t) andsâ€²= (xâ€²,t) that diï¬€er at most by klattice steps,
 namely for |xâ€²âˆ’x|< kand|tâ€²âˆ’t|< k, for instance with k= 1. This property can follow from
 instance from a discretization of a continuous relativisti c hamiltonian Hthat has ï¬nite degree in the
 derivatives.
 We assume for simplicity that the system is periodic, and the re is an integer Zsuch that TZ= 1 1.
 This does not need to be a periodicity in one of the coordinate s of the extended conï¬guration space.
 The example that follows, for instance, has a periodic dynam ics. Then the generalized projector is
 deï¬ned by
 P=/summationdisplay
 n=1,ZTn. (30)
 (Otherwise, we have to take the limit P= limZâ‡’âˆž1
 Z/summationtext
 n=1,ZTn.) All expressions of the previous
 section continue to hold. In particular, we can still use the coupling (20) to the apparatus system,
 and deï¬ne probabilities amplitudes by (26). This shows that multiple probabilities can be deï¬ned in
 general also in a system without unitary time evolution.
 The physical interpretation of these probabilities is disc ussed in detail in the companion paper [11],
 and will not be repeated here. We only recall here the importa nt fact that in the general case, the
 probability of detecting the event sisnotinterpreted as the number of times the system is detected
 ins,instead of being detected in other positions at equal time . Rather, it is interpreted as the number
 of times the system is detected in s,instead of not being detected . For instance, the number of time a
 detector at swill click, divided the total number of runs of the experimen t. The two deï¬nitions are
 equivalent in the non-relativistic case, because in this ca se if a particle is not at x, then the particle
 must be in another one (and only one other) position of the equ al time surface; in the timeless case
 the ï¬rst deï¬nition becomes meaningless, but the second rema in meaningful.
 As a concrete example, consider a discretized version of the ï¬nite dimensional model studied in
 [15]. In the continuum, this model is deï¬ned by a two-dimensi onal extended conï¬guration space, with
 coordinates aandb, and by the relativistic hamiltonian
 H=1

 p2
 a+p2
 b+a2+b2/parenrightbig
 âˆ’E, (31)
 7whereEis an integer constant. We refer to [15] for all details and mo tivations. The motions are
 closed lines in the extended conï¬gurations space (in fact, e llipses), and therefore this model does not
 admit a conventional hamiltonian formulation (because the motion of a hamiltonian system are always
 monotonic in tand therefore cannot be closed lines). The dynamics of the mo del is determined by the
 dynamics of two harmonic oscillators (with m=Ï‰= 1) with ï¬xed total energy Ea+Eb=E. (The
 diï¬€erence is that here the time variable is assumed to be unob servable.) In fact, the two commuting
 operatorsHa=1
 2/parenleftbig
 p2

 andHb=1

 are diagonalized by the states
 Î¨nanb(a,b) =/an}bracketle{ta,b|na,nb/an}bracketri}ht=Hna(a)Hnb(b) (32)
 wherena,nb= 0,1,...,âˆžandHn(x) are the harmonic oscillator eigenstates. Of course:
 |a,b/an}bracketri}ht=âˆž/summationdisplay
 na=0âˆž/summationdisplay
 nb=0Hna(a)Hnb(b)|na,nb/an}bracketri}ht. (33)
 The relativistic hamiltonian gives
 H|na,nb/an}bracketri}ht= (Ea+Ebâˆ’E)|na,nb/an}bracketri}ht= (na+nb+ 1âˆ’E)|na,nb/an}bracketri}ht. (34)

 For more details, see [15].
 Let us discretize this model, in order to avoid probability d ensities and distributions. This can
 be done as follows. Choose an integer Nâ‰«E. Cut-down the kinematical phase space to the space
 spanned by the states where |na,nb/an}bracketri}ht, na,nb= 0,1,...,N âˆ’1. We write N= 2M+ 1 for later
 convenience. Introduce the discretized â€œposition statesâ€ by analogy with (33), as
 |a,b/an}bracketri}ht:=Nâˆ’1/summationdisplay
 na=0Nâˆ’1/summationdisplay
 nb=0Hna(a)Hnb(b)|na,nb/an}bracketri}ht (37)
 wherea,b=âˆ’MÎ´,âˆ’(Mâˆ’1)Î´,...,0,...,(Mâˆ’1)Î´,MÎ´, andÎ´is a suitably chosen small real number.1
 Notice that aandbare here discrete variables. The resulting discrete model can be taken as a dis crete
 approximation of the model studied in [15].
 1We want the lattice spacing to satisfy Î´â‰ª1 in order to be much smaller than the harmonic oscillator vac uum
 state widthp
 /planckover2pi1/mÏ‰, otherwise the vacuum state lattice approximation would be very rough. In the present casep
 /planckover2pi1/mÏ‰= 1, since we have chosen units where /planckover2pi1=m=Ï‰= 1. We also want the lattice spacing to be much smaller
 than the minimum allowed wavelength: the wavelength is the l ength on which the state varies; in order for the state
 to be well approximated by a state on the lattice, the lattice spacing must be much smaller. Since the maximum
 momentum allowed by the constraint is pmaxâˆ¼âˆš
 2E, this implies that Î´â‰ª2Ï€/planckover2pi1
 pmax, that is, Î´â‰ª2Ï€âˆš
 2E. Finally, we
 choose Msuch that the (ï¬nite size) region covered by the lattice is mu ch larger than the maximum amplitude, that is,
 this region should be large enough to accommodate any state. This implies Mâ‰«âˆš
 2E/Î´, therefore Nâ‰«E. Under
 these conditions, there are all reasons to believe that the q uantum dynamics of the discrete model approximates well
 the continuum one.
 8The projector can then be written in the discrete form
 P=Eâˆ’1/summationdisplay
 n=0|n,Eâˆ’1âˆ’n/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketle{tn,Eâˆ’1âˆ’n|=1

 whereH|na,nb/an}bracketri}ht= (na+nb+ 1âˆ’E)|na,nb/an}bracketri}ht. (Remember that 2 Nis the total number of kinematical
 states.) Equivalently
 P=1
 2N2N/summationdisplay
 Ï„=1TÏ„(39)
 where
 T=eâˆ’2Ï€iH/2N(40)
 is the matrix giving the one-step parameter-time evolution in the discretized model. Its matrix
 elements are
 Taâ€²bâ€²ab=/an}bracketle{taâ€²,bâ€²|T |a,b/an}bracketri}ht=Nâˆ’1/summationdisplay
 na=0Nâˆ’1/summationdisplay
 nb=0Hna(aâ€²)Hnb(bâ€²)e2Ï€i(na+nb+1âˆ’E)/2NHna(a)Hnb(b).(41)
 Using this matrix, the matrix elements of the projectors can be written as a sum over histories, as in
 (12), where, now, s= (a,b) and we sum over all histories long at most 2 Nsteps.
 We are now ready to couple the system to an apparatus and calcu late multiple-event probabilities.
 Letâ€™s say we have an apparatus that detects the system at the p oint (a1,b1). Then we modify Tas
 follows
 Taâ€²bâ€²abâ†’(Ta1b1)aâ€²bâ€²Aâ€²abA=Taâ€²bâ€²abÎ´A
 Aâ€²+Î´ab

 Aâ€²âˆ’Î´A

 . (42)
 This gives the projector
 Pa1b1=2N/summationdisplay
 Ï„=1(Ta1b1)Ï„(43)
 and the probability amplitude of ï¬nding the system at the poi nt (aâ€²,bâ€²) of the extended conï¬guration
 space, with the detector having detected the system in the po int (a1,b1), if the system was detected
 at the point ( a,b) with the detector in the |No/an}bracketri}htstate, is
 A(a,b)â‡’((a1,b1),(aâ€²,bâ€²))=/an}bracketle{taâ€²,bâ€²,Yes|Pa1,b1|a,b,No /an}bracketri}ht (44)
 This is a well-deï¬ned multiple-event probability in a syste m without unitary time evolution. This
 shows that the prescription of [11] can be implemented, at le ast in principle, also in a system without
 unitary time evolution.
 We close with a conjecture. It should be interesting to consi der the semiclassical limit of these
 probabilities. In [15], semiclassical coherent states cor responding to classical trajectories (ellipses)
 were constructed. Consider a semiclassical kinematical wa ve packet peaked around the point ( a,b),
 and with velocity ( pa,pb). This state is projected by Ponto a a semiclassical state peaked along the
 corresponding ellipses. In [15], it was shown that the kinem atical state space splits into clockwise
 and anticlockwise moving states. Let ÏˆC
 abandÏˆA
 abbe two such states, belonging to the clockwise and
 anticlockwise subspace, respectively, both generating a s emiclassical motion along a given ellipses (but
 in opposite directions). Let ( a,b), (aâ€²,bâ€²) and (a1,b1) be three points along these ellipses. Consider
 the two transition amplitudes
 AÏˆC
 abâ‡’((a1,b1),(aâ€²,bâ€²))=/an}bracketle{taâ€²,bâ€²,Yes|Pa1,b1|ÏˆC
 ab,No/an}bracketri}ht. (45)
 and
 AÏˆA
 abâ‡’((a1,b1),(aâ€²,bâ€²))=/an}bracketle{taâ€²,bâ€²,Yes|Pa1,b1|ÏˆA
 ab,No/an}bracketri}ht. (46)
 One may expect that in the classical limit the ï¬rst of these am plitudes is suppressed if ( a,b)â‡’(a1,b1)â‡’
 (aâ€²,bâ€²) is ordered anti-clockwise, and the second is suppressed if (a,b)â‡’(a1,b1)â‡’(aâ€²,bâ€²) is ordered
 clockwise.
 96 Conclusion
 Using a simple discrete model, we have shown in detail how mul ti-event probabilities can be com-
 puted in a â€œtimelessâ€ quantum system, governed by a Wheeler- DeWitt-like equation, instead than a
 SchrÂ¨ odinger equation. We have computed these probabiliti es using the strategy introduced in [11],
 namely the observation that multi-event probabilities can be interpreted as probabilities for a single
 event, if the event includes the presence of a â€œrecordâ€ of a fe ature of the system measured by an
 apparatus that has interacted with the system itself.
 In words, to say that
 (i) a particle has been detected at ( x1,t1)andat (x2,t2) can be interpreted as meaning that we detect
 a state in which
 (ii) the particle is detected at ( x2,t2) and there is a record that the particle has interacted with a nother
 system at ( x1,t1).
 This interpretation is conceptually satisfying, since how else could we combine events happening at
 diï¬€erent times, if not by having records? The key diï¬€erence b etween (i) and (ii) is of course that in
 conventional quantum mechanics the property of being at ( x1,t1) and the property of being at ( x2,t2)
 are represented by quantum operators that do not commute. Wh ile the property of being detected at
 (x2,t2) and the existence of a record that the particle has interact ed with another system at ( x1,t1)
 are expressed by operators that commute: hence there is a sin gle state where both properties are
 sharp.
 Notice that nothing in the construction presented here assu res us that the probabilities computed
 are independent from the dynamics of the apparatus and its co upling. In fact, in general, the opposite
 may very well be the case, especially in more complicated sit uations, or in the continuous case. This
 is not a defect of the formalism. To the contrary, it is an indi cation from the theory that physically
 diï¬€erent apparatuses may give diï¬€erent results (see [13] an d references therein). In other words, the
 philosophy here is not that an abstract apparatus-independ ent probability has to be well deï¬ned.
 Rather, in any concrete physical situation, where a given ap paratus is present, the formalism should
 be capable of providing the probabilities of the observable outcomes.
