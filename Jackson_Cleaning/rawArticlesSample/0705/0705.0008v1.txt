 Abstract: We study the class of four-dimensional N= 4 supergravities obtained by
 gauging the axionic shift and axionic rescaling symmetries. We formulate these theories
 using the machinery of embedding tensors, characterize the full gauge algebras and discuss
 several specic features of this family of gauged supergravities. We exhibit in particular
 a generalized duality between massive vectors and massive two-forms in four dimensions,
 inherited from the gauging of the shift symmetry. We show that these theories can be
 deduced from higher dimensions by a Scherk{Schwarz reduction, where a twist with respect
 to a non-compact symmetry is required. The four-dimensional generalized duality plays a
 crucial role in identifying the higher-dimensional ascendent.

 1. Introduction
 The eective eld theories describing the low-energy dynamics of typical string and M-
 theory compactications are plagued with massless scalar elds that hamper any attempt to
 contact four-dimensional phenomenology. One way of eliminating some of these unwanted
 massless scalars is the introduction of 
 uxes in the internal compactication space (see [1]
 for a review). From the eective eld theory perspective, turning on 
 uxes corresponds to
 a \gauging" of the original theory obtained without 
 uxes. The term gauging refers to the
 fact that a subgroup of the global duality symmetry of the original theory is promoted to
 a local gauge symmetry. Alternatively, part of the original Abelian gauge symmetry can
 be promoted to a non-Abelian one and all the elds, including the scalars, acquire minimal
 couplings to the gauge elds. The connection with the moduli stabilization issue stems
 from the fact that for extended supergravity theories, the only way to generate a potential
 is through the gauging. The resulting theories are known as gauged supergravities (see [2]
 for a concise review).
 One can envisage a bottom-up approach to the problem of moduli stabilization where
 instead of looking for a specic higher-dimensional background whose corresponding low-
 energy eective theory is phenomenologically viable, one rst constructs a gauged super-
 gravity theory with the required phenomenological properties and then attempts to engi-
 neer it from higher dimensions. Such a programme was initiated in [3] and models were
 proposed there exhibiting full moduli stabilization.
 { 1 {Evidently such a programme depends crucially on having a good picture of the \land-
 scape" of possible gauged supergravity theories. Therefore, a problem of paramount impor-
 tance is to classify and describe all possible gaugings of supergravity in diverse spacetime
 dimensions and with various amounts of supersymmetry. This problem was tackled in a
 series of publications [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] where the general method of embedding tensors was
 developed.
 Ultimately, however, one would like to know that the eective theory constructed
 in the bottom-up approach is consistent, i.e. can be embedded in a certain string or M-
 theory setup. Although for many classes of gauged supergravities their higher-dimensional
 realization is known, for the generic gauged supergravity there is no recipe { not even
 guaranteed existence of a higher-dimensional origin. Presumably such an endeavor would
 require a better understanding of the classes of string backgrounds dubbed non-geometric,
 whose signicance has recently been investigated in the framework of 
 ux compactications
 and supergravity theories.
 Here, our aim is to contribute in this direction by analyzing a family of four-dimensional
 N= 4 gauged supergravities and explain how they can be obtained from string theory or
 higher-dimensional supergravity theories. Gauged supergravity with N= 4 supersymme-
 try was the arena of [3] since string theories with 16 supercharges are the starting point
 of a variety of realistic string constructions. Recently the most general theory of this type
 was explicitly constructed in [9] using the formalism of embedding tensors. We will use
 this formalism to study in detail the specic class of N= 4 theories obtained by gauging
 the axionic symmetries, namely the axionic shifts and rescalings . Consistency requires that
 severalSO(6;6) directions are also gauged. The general structure of the gauge algebra is
 systematically worked and it exhibits the following characteristic property: it is non-
 at
 contrary to what happens in more conventional gaugings.
 In order to uncover the higher-dimensional origin of these gaugings one needs to per-
 form a Scherk{Schwarz reduction of heterotic supergravity (or of the common sector in
 general) on a torus. The crucial ingredient here is a twist by a non-compact duality sym-
 metry of ten-dimensional supergravity.
 The identication of the theory obtained from the reduction with the gauged supergrav-
 ity under consideration is not at all straightforward. It relies heavily on a duality between
 massive vectors and massive two-forms in four dimensions. This duality is a necessary
 extension of the more standard duality between a massless two-form and an axion scalar
 eld in four dimensions : it incorporates the St uckelberg-like terms that are generated by
 the axionic gauging.
 The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 is devoted to a reminder of
 gauged [10, 11, 12] N= 4 supergravity in D= 4 [13, 14, 15]. We emphasize the approach
 of the embedding tensor following Refs. [8, 9, 16]. In Sec. 3 we specialize to the so-called
 electric gaugings and we analyze a particular class of algebras for which we elaborate on
 the corresponding gauged supergravity. These theories admit two equivalent formulations
 related by a duality between massive vectors and massive two-forms in four dimensions. In
 Sec. 4 we move on to higher dimensions. Our aim is to analyze the ten-dimensional origin
 of the four-dimensional theory constructed in Sec. 3. We show that it can be obtained
 { 2 {using a generalized Scherk{Schwarz reduction of heterotic N= 1D= 10 supergravity.
 Furthermore, we comment on the higher-dimensional origin of other classes of N= 4
 gaugings. In Sec. 5 we present our conclusions and discuss some open problems.
 2. Reminder on N= 4 gauged supergravities in D= 4
 In this section we review N= 4 gauged supergravity following Ref. [9]. After some general
 remarks on the possible gauge algebras and the constraints on the gauging parameters we
 present for reference the most general bosonic Lagrangian.
 2.1 Gauge algebras and the embedding tensor
 Four-dimensional N= 4 supergravity has a very restricted structure. It contains gener-
 ically the gravity multiplet and nvector multiplets. The bosonic sector of the theory
 consists of the graviton, n+ 6 vectors and 2 + 6 nscalars. In the ungauged version, the
 gauge group is Abelian, U(1)6+n, and there is no potential for the scalars.
 Interactions are induced upon elimination of the auxiliary elds. They aect the scalars
 whose non-linearities are captured by a universal coset manifold [17, 18]
 M=SL(2;R)
 U(1)SO(6;n)
 SO(6)SO(n): (2.1)
 All elds are non-minimally coupled to the Abelian vectors. The gauge kinetic terms have
 scalar-eld-dependent coecients, whereas the action is at most quadratic in the gauge-
 eld strengths with no explicit dependence on the gauge potentials. For this reason, the
 SL(2;R)SO(6;n)Sp(12+2n;R) symmetry of the scalar manifold is globally realized as
 a U-duality symmetry. Although the scalar manifold survives any deformation of the plain
 theory triggered by gaugings, the U-duality is broken as a consequence of the introduction
 of non-Abelian eld strengths and minimal couplings, all of which depend explicitly on the
 gauge potentials.
 The duality group acts as a symmetry of the eld equations and the Bianchi identities
 of the gauge elds. In the standard formulation of supergravity only a subgroup of it is
 realized o-shell as a genuine symmetry of the Lagrangian. This includes the SO(6;n)
 plus a two-dimensional non-semi-simple subalgebra of SL(2;R) generated by axionic shifts
 and axionic rescalings. The third transformation in SL(2;R), corresponding to the truly
 electric-magnetic duality, is an on-shell symmetry which relates dierent Lagrangians as-
 sociated to dierent choices of symplectic frames.
 The only known deformation of N= 4 supergravity compatible with supersymmetry
 is the gauging . This consists in transmuting part of the U(1)6+nlocal symmetry into an
 non-Abelian gauge symmetry, or equivalently in promoting part of the global U-duality
 symmetry to a local symmetry, using some of the available vectors. This operation should
 not alter the total number of propagating degrees of freedom, as required e.g. by super-
 symmetry.
 It is possible to parameterize all gaugings of N= 4 supergravity by using the so-called
 embedding tensor . The latter describes how the gauge algebra is realized in terms of the
 { 3 {U-duality generators. It captures all possible situations, including those where some of the
 gauge elds are the magnetic duals of the vectors originally present in the Lagrangian, as
 well as the option of gauging the duality rotation between electric and magnetic vectors,
 which, as already stressed, appears only as an on-shell symmetry. In this procedure, one
 doubles the number of vector degrees of freedom, keeping however unchanged the number
 of propagating ones thanks to appropriate auxiliary elds. One therefore avoids any choice
 of symplectic frame until a specic gauging is performed. We will not elaborate on these
 general properties but summarize the structure of the embedding tensor that we will use
 in the ensuing. We refer the reader to [8, 9, 16] for further information on this subject.
 Then+6 electric vector elds AM+; M= 1;:::; 6+nbelong to the fundamental vector
 representation of SO(6;n). Their magnetic duals AM form also a vector of SO(6;n), but
 carry opposite charge with respect to the SO(1;1)SL(2;R) that generates the axionic
 rescalings.
 TheSL(2;R) algebra is generated by S=S; ;2f+; g, which obey the
 following commutation relations:

 The gauging ofN= 4 supergravity proceeds by selecting a subalgebra of SL(2;R)
 SO(6;n) generated by some linear combination of fS;TKLg. The coecients of this
 combination are the components of the embedding tensor and are subject to various con-
 straints discussed in detail in the aforementioned references. In summary, this tensor
 belongs a priori to the ( 23;Vec) + (2;VecAdj) ofSL(2;R)SO(6;n). However,
 there are linear constraints resulting from the requirement that the commutator provides
 an adjoint action and that supersymmetry is preserved3. These reduce the representation
 content of the embedding tensor to ( 2;Vec)+(2;Ant [3]). Furthermore, there are quadratic
 constraints guaranteeing the closure of the gauge algebra { Jacobi identity. Putting ev-
 erything together, one nds that the admissible generators of the gauge algebra are of the
 form

 2IndicesM;N;::: are lowered and raised with LJandKM(inverse matrix).
 3This is actually the minimal set of constraints that one can consistently impose and they also guarantee
 that a Lagrangian exists propagating the correct number of degrees of freedom, as one learns from general
 studies on gaugings of maximal supergravities [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
 { 5 {Several comments are in order here. A general gauging is manifestly expressed in terms
 of 2(6 +n) + 2(6+n)(5+n)(4+n)=6parameters subject to four conditions (i,ii,iii,iv). The
 gauge algebra, as dened by this set of parameters, is characterized by the commutation
 relations of the subset of independent  L's. These generators are indeed constrained
 (they satisfy e.g.  (L)MLM= 0 as a consequence of their denition (2.8) and Eqs.
 (2.9), (2.10), (2.11)) as they should since no more that 6 + nvectors can propagate. The
 structure constants of the gauge algebra are not directly read o from the fLMN 's, which
 are not necessarily structure constants of some algebra. They can, however, be expressed in
 terms of the fLMN 's andM's and describe a variety of situations which capture simple,
 semi-simple or even non-semi-simple examples. For all of these, MNalways provides an
 invariant metric although the Cartan{Killing metric of the corresponding gauge algebra
 can be degenerate.
 The duality phases of de Roo and Wagemans [19, 20, 21] are also captured by the
 present formalism when the M's are absent4, as relative orientations of f+LMN with
 respect tof LMN for each simple component [9]. We will not elaborate any longer on the
 general aspects of the embedding tensor and the variety of physical possibilities and for
 further details we will refer the reader to the already quoted literature.
 2.2 Lagrangian formulation
 The bosonic Lagrangian corresponding to the most general N= 4 gauging was presented
 in [9]. For the sake of completeness we reproduce this result here and provide several
 comments. The Lagrangian consists of a kinetic term, a topological term, and a potential
 for the scalars:
 L=Lkin+Ltop+Lpot: (2.13)

 The basic feature of this Lagrangian is that it depends explicitly on both the electric
 gauge potentials AM+
 and their magnetic duals AM 
 . Therefore it allows the gauging of
 any subgroup of the full duality group SL(2;R)SO(6;n), where in principle both electric
 and magnetic potentials can participate. The eld equations derived from this Lagrangian
 and the gauge transformations can be found in [9].
 3. Gauging the N= 4 axionic symmetries
 Here we present a class of N= 4 gauged supergravities obtained by making local the
 axionic shifts and axionic rescalings. This is a subclass of the electric gaugings and we will
 refer to them as non-unimodular gaugings . Their existence was pointed out in [9] but here
 we analyze in detail and full generality the properties of the corresponding gauge algebra
 and discuss some interesting features of their Lagrangian description, such as a duality
 between massive vectors and massive two-forms.
 3.1 Electric-magnetic duality and electric gaugings
 The most general N= 4 gauging is described in terms of two tensors fLMN andI,
 ;2f+; gandI;L;M;N2f1;:::; 6 +ng, satisfying four quadratic conditions (i, ii,
 iii, iv) displayed in Eqs. (2.9){(2.12). This general formalism, dened in an arbitrary sym-
 plectic frame, captures in particular the gauging of the electric-magnetic duality symmetry
 generated by S++(see Sec. 2.1).
 Gaugings with pure fLMN 's have been studied extensively in the literature. They
 correspond to switching on gauge algebras entirely embedded in SO(6;n), as shown by
 (2.8). On the other hand, turning on the I's allows one to gauge both SL(2;R) and
 SO(6;n). This situation has not attracted much attention and only a few examples of the
 corresponding gauge algebras have been analyzed (see e.g. [9, 35]). Our aim is to study
 { 7 {systematically a class of such gaugings and show that they correspond to a specic pattern
 of higher-dimensional reduction which generalizes the Scherk{Schwarz mechanism.
 We will focus here on electric gaugings, namely gaugings that do not involve the S++
 generator of SL(2;R). Axionic shifts S  or axionic rescalings S +will however be gauged,
 accompanied by the appropriate SO(6;n) generators. Hence, this class of gaugings is
 dened by setting
  I= 0: (3.1)
 We will also set
 f LMN = 0; (3.2)
 although this is not compulsory for electric gaugings5, while keeping +II6= 0 and
 f+LMNfLMN6= 0. Furthermore, we will focus on the case n= 6, which is related to
 pure gravity in ten dimensions, and adopt the o-block-diagonal 6 + 6 metric:
 = 
 0I6
 I60!
 : (3.3)
 The quadratic constraint (iii), Eq. (2.11), is now automatically satised while the
 constraints (i, ii, iv) { Eqs. (2.9), (2.10), (2.12) { reduce to
 MNMN= 0; MNMfNIJ= 0; (3.4)
 MNfMI[JfKL]N=2
 3f[IJKL]: (3.5)
 3.2 Non-unimodular gaugings
 We will split the I-indices into ( i;i0) with both iandi0ranging from 1 to 6. This corresponds
 to the decomposition of the fundamental representation of SO(6;6) into fundamental and
 contragradient of the diagonal SO(6) subgroup. With this convention, ij=i0j0= 0,
 whereasii0=i0i=ii0. In this basis the SO(6;6)-invariant inner product takes the form
 AMBM=AmBm+Am0Bm0and we can write AmAm0;Am0Am.
 A specic solution with f's and's. Now, a non-trivial solution to Eqs. (3.4) and
 (3.5) is
 i=ii0= 0 for all i0; (3.6)
 fi0ij=fiji0=fji0i= [ij]i0all others vanishing ; (3.7)
 withiarbitrary real numbers. The existence of the gauging described in Eqs. (3.6) and
 (3.7) was pointed out in Ref. [9]. Actually, there exist a whole class of gaugings of this type
 with more components of the tensor fIJKturned on. As discussed in [9], besides Eqs. (3.6)
 and (3.7) one can turn on fijk. Then, the quadratic constraints reduce to a single equation
 f[ijkl]= 0: (3.8)
 5What is meant by electric gauging is not universally set in the literature. In [9], for example, electric
 gaugings are dened as those with I=f LMN = 0, which is somewhat too restrictive.
 { 8 {Since the novel feature of this class of gaugings is the presence of a non-zero parameter,
 we will restrict ourselves to the simplest example, namely the gauging with fijk= 0.
 The gauging under consideration will be called \non-unimodular" for reasons that will
 become clear at the end of Sec. 4.2, or \tracefull" since
 fj
 ij= 5
 2i: (3.9)
 This is slightly misleading, however, since the gauge algebra istraceless as a consequence
 of the full antisymmetry of its genuine structure constants. The latter are notfk
 ijbut
 specic combinations of fIJKandIread o from the commutation relations of generators
 (2.8).
 The gauge algebra. In the rest of this section, we will characterize the gauge algebra,
 which will be further studied from a higher-dimensional perspective in the next chapters.
 Using Eqs. (3.6) and (3.7) in expression (2.8), we obtain:

 The gauge algebra at hand has 18 non-vanishing generators, but only 8 are independent :
 ;;i0. Their commutation relations follow from Eqs. (2.2) and (2.6):
 
 i0;j0

 [i0;] = i0; (3.16)

 The setf;i0gspans an Abelian seven-dimensional Lie subalgebra. Furthermore, the
 algebra generated by f;gis a non-compact A2;2subalgebra of SL(2;R)SO(6;6).
 The above algebra is non-
 at , in contrast to the algebras obtained by standard Scherk{
 Schwarz reductions. As we will see in later, the gaugings at hand are related to twisted
 versions of these reductions, which relax therefore the 
 atness of the gauge algebras. In the
 particular case where i=1i, the gauge algebra possesses 7 non-vanishing generators.
 This algebra appears when compactifying from ve to four dimensions (see [35]) with a non-
 compact twist generated by the ve-dimensional rescaling. The full algebra (3.10){(3.17)
 will also emerge (see Sec. 4) as a ten-dimensional heterotic reduction with twist. Richer
 non-Abelian extensions are possible in this case, that eventually lead to non-vanishing fijk
 as already advertised, and which are not possible when compactifying from ve dimensions.
 These issues will be extensively analyzed in Sec. 4.2.
 { 9 {3.3 Lagrangian description
 It is straightforward to derive the bosonic Lagrangian for the gaugings we have just de-
 scribed by using the general formulas of the previous section. As a rst step, we will
 implement (3.1) and (3.2), and later set (3.6) and (3.7). Finally, we will dualize a vector,
 which acquires a St uckelberg-like mass via the gauging at hand, into a massive two-form
 eld potential.

 where the two-form Cacquires now a scalar-eld-dependent mass.
 The key observation is that the theory described by (3.36) is related to that described
 by (3.35) by an interesting generalized duality. Recall that a massless two-form potential
 in four dimensions carries one propagating degree of freedom and can be dualized into a
 scalar. In the case where the two-form comes from the reduction of the ten-dimensional
 NS-NS two-form in the gravity multiplet, the dual scalar is the axion. If instead, as it
 happens here, the two-form is massive, it carries three degrees of freedom and the dual
 potential is a massive vector. This duality is a particular instance of a generalized duality
 between massive p-forms and massive ( D p 1)-forms in Ddimensions [22, 23].
 For the benet of the reader we will present schematically how this generalized duality
 works, leaving as an exercise its precise implementation between (3.35) and (3.36). Start
 from a massive gauge eld Xwith Lagrangian

 we can integrate by parts~~Lso thatXbecomes non-dynamical, while Cacquires a

 which can be brought to a more familiar form for antisymmetric tensors, by Hodge{

 Following a similar pattern, one can replace the massive vector XinL(Eq. (3.35))
 by a two-form. This yields precisely ~L(Eq. (3.36)), therefore demonstrating that the
 LagrangiansLand ~Ldescribe equivalent physics.
 4. Higher-dimensional origin
 In this section we perform a generalized dimensional reduction of heterotic supergravity to
 four dimensions and show that the resulting eective theory belongs to the class of N= 4
 gauged supergravities studied in the previous section. Recall that the usual dimensional
 reduction of heterotic supergravity, which can be thought of as compactication on a
 six-torus keeping only the massless modes, results in a four-dimensional theory with 16
 supercharges, Abelian gauge group U(1)12+pand a global o-shell symmetry SO(6;6 +p)
 [24]. Six of the Abelian vectors are graviphotons while another six of them come from
 reducing the NS-NS two-form on the 1-cycles of the torus.
 One can also reduce some of the vectors present already in ten dimensions and obtain p
 additional Abelian gauge elds. Usually this is done for the vectors lying in the Cartan torus
 of the ten-dimensional gauge group, therefore yielding a theory with p= 16. Since our goal
 here is to make contact with a gauged supergravity with p= 0 we will ignore this possibility
 and consider the reduction of the gravity-multiplet elds only. It is straightforward to
 extend the reduction to the Yang{Mills sector and obtain generalizations of the gaugings
 we discussed so far.
 4.1 Heterotic reduction with duality twist

 We assume a decomposition of the ten-dimensional spacetime in a four-dimensional non-
 compact part M4parameterized by coordinates xand a six-dimensional internal manifold
 K6parameterized by yi. The spacetime indices will be decomposed as M= (;i). As usual
  is the dilaton and H= dBis the three-form eld strength of the NS-NS antisymmetric
 tensorB. As said, we neglect the ten-dimensional Yang{Mills elds.
 7The ten-dimensional spacetime indices M;N;::: of this section should not be confused with the funda-
 mentalSO(6;6) indices of the previous sections.
 { 13 {TakingK6to be a 
 at six-torus and keeping only the y-independent modes yields a
 theory with 12 Abelian vectors and 38 massless scalars, two of which are the dilaton and
 the axion. The latter is the dual of the two-form Bobtained by reducing BMN. One
 way to obtain a more interesting theory is by introducing 
 uxes in the torus. The most
 general reduction of this type, where both NS-NS and geometric 
 uxes were present, was
 studied in [25].
 The introduction of geometric 
 uxes has an alternative interpretation as a reduction
 with a twist for the spacetime elds [26]. This is actually a particular case of a generalized
 reduction scheme that usually is referred to as \Scherk{Schwarz" reduction [27]. The char-
 acteristic property of reductions of this type is that the reduction ansatz can incorporate a
 dependance on the coordinates of the internal torus. This dependance is not arbitrary how-
 ever; on a technical level it is dictated by the requirement that the Lagrangian should be
 independent of the internal coordinates. This is implemented by selecting a prole for the
 elds whose consistency is guaranteed by some symmetry of the original theory. Such re-
 ductions in the context of supergravity have been studied in [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]
 while the reader is referred to [37] for a general discussion on reductions with duality twists.
 A subtle point that is not usually emphasized is the following. These reduction schemes
 yield an eective theory for a nite set of modes selected out of the innitude of higher-
 dimensional modes according to some symmetry principle. Hence, it is not necessarily
 true that they encompass all low-energy modes and further analysis is required in order to
 establish that the eective theory obtained through a Scherk{Schwarz reduction is actually
 alow-energy eective theory.
 The symmetry we will employ in the present paper is the SO(1;1) scaling symmetry
 of (4.1), under which the elds transform as
 ! + 4; GMN!eGMN(x); BMN!eBMN(x): (4.2)
 This enables us to trade the usual periodic ansatz, which assumes no dependance on the
 torus coordinates, with the following one
 (x;y) = (x) + 4iyi; GMN(x;y) = eiyiGMN(x); BMN(x;y) = eiyiBMN(x):(4.3)
 The parameters iare arbitrary real numbers that dictate the twisting of the elds along
 the six one-cycles of the torus.
 The decomposition of the ten-dimensional metric tensor in terms of four-dimensional
 elds is the usual one
 G=g+Ai
 Aj
 hij; Gi=Aj
 hij; Gij=hij: (4.4)
 Heregis the metric on M4,hijare the 21 metric moduli of the six-torus and Ai
 are the
 Kaluza{Klein gauge elds. Similarly, the antisymmetric tensor is decomposed as
 B=b; Bi=bi; Bij=bij: (4.5)
 We obtain a two-form b, which usually is dualized to an axion, six vectors Bi
 and 15
 scalar moduli bij.
 { 14 {The above decompositions hold for the full ten-dimensional elds that are assumed to
 have a dependance on yiof the type dictated by the SO(1;1) scaling symmetry. Consistency
 implies that
 g(x;y) = ekykg(x); b(x;y) = ekykb(x); hij(x;y) = ekykhij(x);(4.6)
 bij(x;y) = ekykbij(x); Ai
 (x;y) =Ai
 (x); bi(x;y) = ekykbi(x); (4.7)
 (x;y) =(x) +kyk; (4.8)
 where the four-dimensional dilaton is dened as =  1
 2log det h. They-independent
 modes on the right-hand sides are the four-dimensional elds for which we would like to
 derive the eective action. The ansatz is consistent in the sense that the y-dependance is
 totally eliminated from the action and the integration over yiyields an overall multiplicative
 factor. Notice that the volume of the internal six-torus is encoded in the metric moduli
 hij.
 Let us rst reduce the Einstein{Hilbert part of the action along with the dilaton kinetic
 term. The most ecient way of performing this reduction is the following. We start from
 the metric
 G0
 MN(x;y) = 
 2(y)GMN(x); (4.9)
 where 
 (y) = exp(1
 2yii), use the relation between Ricci scalars for conformally related
 metrics, and nally apply the usual reduction formulas for GMN(x). After the above
 redenition of the dilaton, necessary for absorbing the factor ofp
 h, the conformal rescaling
 g!exp

 There are several observations in order. First, the metric moduli hijbecome charged

 . The charges are given by the vector of twisting
 coecients i. The dilaton is also coupled in a St uckelberg fashion to Ai
 . This signals the
 gauging of a shift symmetry as expected from a reduction where the ansatz was twisted
 by employing such a symmetry8. Notice, furthermore, that the twisting does not result in
 a non-Abelian gauge symmetry for the Kaluza{Klein gauge elds. It does however lead to
 a potential for the dilaton and the metric moduli.
 The reduction of the NS-NS part of the Lagrangian is more easily performed using the
 tangent-space components of the antisymmetric three-form [24]. Furthermore, some eld

 We observe that the NS-NS moduli are charged under the Kaluza{Klein gauge elds
 but have also St uckelberg couplings to the NS-NS gauge potentials. The latter couplings
 are due to the gauging of the shift symmetries of those moduli induced by the duality twist.
 A crucial dierence with the case of the ordinary dimensional reduction is that the four-
 dimensional two-form Bacquires a mass. This prohibits the standard dual formulation
 in terms of an axion but, according to the discussion of the previous section on dualities
 between massive elds, suggests that a dual formulation in terms of a massive vector is
 possible. Let us nally stress that the reduction of the NS-NS sector also contributes to
 the potential for the hijandbijmoduli (last line of (4.13)).
 4.2 Contact with N= 4gauged supergravity
 We will now show that the eective theory described by the sum of actions (4.10) and
 (4.13) is nothing but the N= 4 gauged supergravity worked out in Sec. 3. Using the
 standard parameterization of the moduli matrix MMN

 j: (4.18)
 This is precisely the potential in the eective theory (4.10) plus (4.13). Notice that this
 identication claries the higher-dimensional interpretation of the gauging parameters :
 they correspond to the parameters used to twist the boundary conditions by SO(1;1)
 scalings along the six one-cycles of the torus.
 It is straightforward to check that the rest of the terms in (4.10) plus (4.13) match
 exactly those of (3.36) provided we identify the gauge elds Am
 ;Am0
 in the gauged-
 supergravity Lagrangian with the Kaluza{Klein and NS-NS gauge elds Am
 ;Ymin the
 heterotic reduction and the antisymmetric tensors as C$2B. This elucidates the
 higher-dimensional origin of the gauged supergravity of Sec. 3 and conrms the promi-
 nent role of the generalized duality performed in four dimensions for reaching (3.36). It
 is amusing that the four-dimensional two-form Bthat comes from the NS-NS antisym-
 metric tensor in ten dimensions is actually the auxiliary tensor gauge eld required for
 consistency of the gauging in the formalism of [8].
 Let us mention at this point that ordinary reductions of the heterotic theory with
 NS-NS 
 uxes and geometric 
 uxes also yield N= 4 gauged supergravities [25]. The
 correspondence with the embedding-tensor language is as follows: there are no 's turned
 on and the only non-vanishing parameters are the f+IJKfIJK. Under the decomposition
 of indicesI= (i;i0), the background NS-NS 
 uxes ijkand geometric 
 uxes9
 k
 ijare
 identied with the components of fIJKas
 fijk= 3ijk; fijk0= 2
 k
 ij; (4.19)
 all other components being zero. The remaining non-trivial quadratic constraint is (iv)
 (Eq. (2.12)) and it corresponds to the Bianchi identities for the NS-NS 
 uxes and the
 Jacobi identity for the geometric 
 uxes. From this we conclude that the more general class
 of gaugings we mentioned in Sec. 3.2 with non-zero fijkoriginates from a ten-dimensional
 reduction with an SO(1;1) duality twist combined with background NS-NS 
 uxes. The
 condition (3.8) found then is a consequence of the Bianchi identity resulting from the ansatz
 (4.3).
 An interesting observation is in order here. The correspondence between the compo-
 nentsfijk0and the geometric 
 uxes 
 k
 ijprovides an alternative perspective on the gauging
 we have performed in Sec. 3.2 and the subsequent heterotic reduction of Sec. 4.1. Indeed, if
 we interpret the y-dependance of the internal metric (c.f. Eqs. (4.6)) as inducing a geomet-
 ric 
 ux, this 
 ux is automatically \non-unimodular" since 
 i
 ij6= 0. In ordinary reductions,
 the unimodularity condition ensures consistency of the truncation of the higher-dimensional
 Lagrangian [26, 38]. This well-known obstruction is circumvented in our approach thanks
 to the compensating duality twist.
 9We use the notation of [25].
 { 17 {5. Conclusions and open problems
 In this paper we studied in detail the class of N= 4 axionic-symmetry gaugings and
 established that they can be embedded in heterotic theory. More specically, they arise
 through a reduction where the boundary conditions for the elds are twisted by an SO(1;1)
 scaling symmetry. Similar reductions are possible for type II strings yielding N= 8
 gauged supergravities or N= 4 upon appropriate orbifolding/orientifolding. For M-theory,
 instead, there is no scaling symmetry of the action and that implies that the Lagrangian
 cannot be consistently truncated for elds with boundary conditions of this type. However,
 one can still perform such reductions at the level of the equations of motion and it is
 expected that the reduced equations of motion correspond to gaugings of the type we
 studied here. In passing, we also note that since the dilaton becomes a component of
 the internal geometry when a type IIA background is lifted to M-theory, reductions with
 dilaton twists should lift to M-theory reductions with purely geometric twists of the type
 studied in [39, 40].
 Some obvious extensions of the current work include twisted reductions of the heterotic
 theory taking into account the ten-dimensional gauge elds or similar type II reductions in
 the presence of branes and orientifolds. This should yield electric N= 4 gaugings where
 the gauge algebra is a subgroup of SL(2;R)SO(6;n) forn6.
 The fact that the formulation of gauged supergravity through the embedding tensor is
 duality-covariant implies that these theories capture the eective dynamics of backgrounds
 related by duality transformations. Recently it has become increasingly clear that the
 majority of these backgrounds are non-geometric and cannot be described using the familiar
 notions of geometry and ordinary 
 uxes. From one point of view this demonstrates the
 power of the eective bottom-up approach, since four-dimensional physics can be derived
 without the need to delve into the microscopic details of a higher-dimensional setup. On
 the other hand, one could argue that a better understanding of non-geometric backgrounds
 may still be obtained through analyzing gauged supergravity.
 For instance, the \non-geometric" 
 uxes QandRproposed in [41] as T-dual of the
 familiar NS-NS and geometric 
 uxes, are automatically captured for heterotic compacti-
 cations on a six-torus by the formulation of N= 4 gauged supergravity we have being
 discussing. Using the notation of [41] our gauging parameters f+IJKdescribe all possible
 situations through
 f+ijkHijk; f +ijk0fk
 ij; f +i0j0kQij
 k; f +i0j0k0Rijk: (5.1)
 Besides this set of SO(6;6)-dual 
 uxes, the most general N= 4 gauging comprises of
 another set of S-dual 
 uxes f IJK. It would be extremely interesting to understand the
 microscopic origin of all those non-geometric 
 uxes directly in ten dimensions and derive
 the corresponding gauged supergravities using an appropriate reduction scheme (see [42]
 for some recent ideas in this direction. Also, the non-geometric 
 uxes can be interpreted as
 geometric 
 uxes in an appropriate generalized geometry [43]). Among others, this should
 shed some light on the open problem of lifting gauged supergravities with non-trivial duality
 phases in heterotic string theory.
 { 18 {A related question concerns the higher-dimensional origin of the gauging constraints
 (i)-(iv). For example, although some of these constraints have a clear origin as Bianchi
 identities in the internal space, this is not so for the null condition (i) MM= 0. The
 reduction we performed depends naturally on six parameters that ll up Min such a way
 that it is automatically null. It would be interesting to understand how N= 4 gaugings
 with more general parameters Mcan be obtained from higher dimensions and where the
 null condition comes from.
 We conclude by emphasizing that formulations of string and M-theory of the type
 presented in [44, 45, 46] as well as the mathematical framework of generalized complex
 geometry [47] may provide the appropriate tools for resolving the above issues.
