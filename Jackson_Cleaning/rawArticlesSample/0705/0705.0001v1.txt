 Abstract
 Caustic rings of dark matter were predicted to exist in the pl ane of the Galaxy at radii anâ‰ƒ
 40 kpc /nforn= 1,2,3... The recently discovered Monoceros Ring of stars is located near the
 n= 2 caustic, prompting us to consider a possible connection b etween these two objects. We
 identify two processes through which the Monoceros Ring of s tars may have formed. One process
 is the migration of gas to an angular velocity minimum at the c austic leading to enhanced star
 formation there. The other is the adiabatic deformation of s tar orbits as the caustic slowly grows
 in mass and radius. The second process predicts an order 100% enhancement of the density of disk
 stars at the location of the caustic ring.

 1I. INTRODUCTION
 The Monoceros Ring is an overdensity of stars in the plane of t he Galaxy at a galacto-
 centric distance of approximately 20 kpc. It was discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
 (SDSS) [1, 2] and its existence was promptly conï¬rmed by two i ndependent collaborations
 [3, 4]. The Monoceros Ring has been observed over 170 degrees in galactic longitude lin the
 Galactic anti-center direction (100â—¦<âˆ¼l<âˆ¼270â—¦), and appears to be circular. Assuming it is a
 complete circle, the total mass in the Ring is estimated to be in the range 2 Â·107âˆ’5Â·108MâŠ™
 in ref. [2], and 2 Â·108âˆ’109MâŠ™in ref. [3]. The scale height of the Ring stars in the directio n
 perpendicular to the Galactic plane is estimated to be 1 .6Â±0.5 kpc in ref. [2], 0 .75Â±0.04
 kpc in ref. [3] and 1 .3Â±0.4 kpc in ref. [4]. The scale height in the direction parallel t o the
 plane is also of order kpc. The stars in the Ring move with spee d approximately 220 km/s
 in the direction of galactic rotation [5, 6]. Their velocity dispersion along the line of sight
 is small. It was estimated to be between 20 and 30 km/s in ref. [ 2], and 20 Â±4 km/s in ref.
 [5].
 The most widely discussed interpretation of the Monoceros R ing is that it is a stream
 of stars resulting from the tidal disruption of a Galactic sa tellite [7, 8, 9]. An alternative
 proposal is that the Ring is a manifestation of the Galactic w arp [10, 11]. In this paper we
 explore a diï¬€erent proposal altogether, namely that the Mon oceros Ring of stars formed as
 a result of the gravitational forces exerted by the second ca ustic ring of dark matter in the
 Milky Way [12].
 Caustic rings of dark matter had been predicted [13], prior t o the discovery of the Mono-
 ceros Ring, to lie in the Galactic plane at radii given by the a pproximate law anâ‰ƒ40 kpc/ n
 where n= 1, 2, 3 ... Since the Monoceros Ring is located near the secon d (n= 2) caustic
 ring of dark matter, it is natural to ask whether the former is a consequence of the latter.
 In our proposal, the position of the Monoceros Ring in the Gal actic plane and its 20 kpc
 radius are immediately accounted for.
 Dark matter caustics are an unavoidable consequence of the f act that cold collisionless
 dark matter (CDM) lies on a 3-dim. hypersurface in 6-dim. pha se space [14, 15, 16, 17].
 The ï¬‚ow of dark matter in and out of the gravitational potenti al well of a galaxy necessarily
 produces caustics. These caustics are of two types, inner an d outer. The inner caustics
 are rings when the angular momentum distribution of the dark matter is dominated by net
 overall rotation [18]. The singularity structure of causti c rings was discussed in detail in ref.
 [15]. The ring radii were predicted in ref. [13] using the sel f-similar infall model of galactic
 halo formation [19, 20], generalized to allow the dark matte r particles to have non-zero
 angular momentum [21]. Evidence for caustic rings of dark ma tter distributed according to
 the prediction of the self-similar infall model was found in the rotation curves of exterior
 galaxies [22] and the rotation curve of the Milky Way [12].
 Fig. 1 shows the transverse section of a caustic ring. Fig. 1( a) shows the ï¬‚ow of dark
 matter in the neighborhood of the caustic, whereas Fig. 1(b) shows the deï¬nition of its
 radius aand its transverse sizes pandq. As was mentioned already, the self-similar infall
 model predicts that the radius a2of the second caustic ring of dark matter is approximately
 20 kpc in our galaxy. The transverse sizes pandqare not predicted by the self-similar infall
 model. However, for reasons explained in Section II, the exp ectation for pandqis that they
 are of order 1 kpc for n= 2. So the transverse sizes of the second caustic ring of dark matter
 are of order the transverse sizes of the Monoceros Ring. More over, for q= 1 kpc, the caustic
 ring mass enclosed within the triangular shape of Fig. 1(b) i s approximately 6 Â·108MâŠ™(see
 2Section II). Thus the total mass of the n= 2 caustic ring of dark matter is of the same order
 of magnitude as the observed total mass of the Monoceros Ring .
 One might ask whether it is possible to interpret the Monocer os Ring as a caustic in a
 ï¬‚ow of stars. Indeed it is reasonable to assume that the ï¬‚ow of dark matter that forms the
 n= 2 caustic ring is accompanied by a ï¬‚ow of stars occupying the same 3-dim. hypersurface
 in phase space. Thus the proposal that the Monoceros Ring is a caustic in a ï¬‚ow of stars
 would explain equally well why the Monoceros Ring is in the Ga lactic plane and why its
 radius is 20 kpc. However, the proposal runs into diï¬ƒculties . The ï¬rst diï¬ƒculty is that the
 self-similar infall model, which predicts the 20 kpc radius of the n= 2 caustic ring, also
 predicts that the matter in that caustic moves with a velocit y of approximately 515 km/s
 in the direction of Galactic rotation (see Section II). This is inconsistent with the 220 km/s
 observed velocity of Monoceros Ring stars in the direction o f galactic rotation. A second
 diï¬ƒculty is that the matter in the caustic ring has an eï¬€ectiv e radial velocity dispersion of
 order 100 km/s, whereas the radial velocity dispersion of Mo noceros Ring stars is only of
 order 20 km/s. Thus the proposal that the Monoceros Ring is a c austic of stars appears
 untenable. As mentioned already, the proposal we explore in stead is that the Monoceros
 Ring is caused by the gravitational ï¬eld of the n= 2 caustic ring of dark matter.
 We will ï¬nd that there are two apparently viable mechanisms b y which the n= 2 caustic
 ring of dark matter may cause the Monoceros Ring of stars. The ï¬rst mechanism is enhanced
 star formation at the caustic radius because viscous forces on the gas in the neighborhood
 of the caustic drive it towards r=a. The second mechanism is the adiabatic deformation of
 the orbits of ordinary disk stars by the caustic ring of dark m atter. We will show that the
 increase in star density at the location of the caustic as a re sult of this second mechanism
 is of order 100%.
 The paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we give a sel f-contained and hopefully
 pedagogical description of the properties of caustic rings of dark matter, including the pre-
 dictions of the self-similar infall model for the parameter s that characterize the caustic rings,
 the observational evidence for caustic rings of dark matter , and the expected properties of
 then= 2 ring. In Section III, we describe the gravitational ï¬eld o f a caustic ring of dark
 matter and the perturbation it causes to the galactic rotati on curve. We then analyze two
 mechanisms by which the second caustic ring of dark matter ma y cause the Monoceros
 Ring: the migration of gas to a sharp minimum in the angular ve locity at r=aimplying
 enhanced star formation there, and the adiabatic deformati on of ordinary disk star orbits
 by the slowly growing caustic. Section IV provides concludi ng remarks. Axial symmetry is
 assumed throughout unless stated otherwise.
 II. CAUSTIC RING PROPERTIES
 Cold collisionless dark matter (CDM) particles lie on a 3-di m. hypersurface in phase
 space [14, 15, 16]. We refer to this 3-dim. hypersurface as th e â€œphase space sheetâ€. At the
 location of a galactic halo, the phase space sheet is wound up so as to cover physical space
 multiple times. This phase space structure implies that the velocity distribution of CDM
 particles is everywhere discrete and that there are surface s in physical space, called caustics,
 where the density of dark matter particles is very large. Dis crete ï¬‚ows and caustics are a
 robust prediction of cold dark matter cosmology [17]. The re ader may wish to consult ref.
 [17] for background information and a list of references.
 Galactic halos have outer caustics and inner caustics. The o uter caustics are a set of
 3simple fold ( A2) catastrophes located on topological spheres surrounding the galaxy at radii
 of order hundreds of kpc. Our focus, however, is on the inner c austics, which are much
 closer to the galactic center. The physical shape and catast rophe structure of inner caustics
 depend on the angular momentum distribution of CDM particle s falling onto the halo [18]. If
 that angular momentum distribution is dominated by net over all rotation, the inner caustics
 are a set of ring-like closed tubes, called â€œcaustic ringsâ€, in or near the galactic plane. In
 cross-section each tube is a section of the elliptic umbilic (Dâˆ’4) catastrophe [15].
 In this section we give a detailed desciption of caustic ring s in the limit of axial symmetry
 and where their cross-sectional sizes, pandq, are much smaller than their radius a. Under
 these assumptions, the distribution of CDM particles in the vicinity of the caustic ring is
 determined in terms of a relatively small number of paramete rs, which we identify. Next,
 we summarize the predictions of the self-similar infall mod el for the caustic ring properties.
 We brieï¬‚y review the evidence for caustic rings of dark matte r, at the radii predicted by the
 self-similar infall model, in the Milky Way and in other isol ated spiral galaxies. Finally, we
 list the expected properties of the second caustic ring of da rk matter in our galaxy.
 A. Catastrophe structure
 The caustic ring singularity was analyzed in ref. [15] which the reader may wish to consult
 for details. In the limit of axial symmetry and where the tran sverse sizes, pandq, of a caustic
 ring are much smaller than its radius a, the distribution of CDM in the vicinity of the caustic
 is given by the particle positions

 We use cylindrical coordinates ( z, Ï, Ï† ) for position in physical space. Eqs. (1) give particle
 positions at a particular time, say t= 0. The particles are labeled by parameters ( Î±, Ï„).
 Î±â‰¡Ï€

 the time when the particle crosses the z= 0 plane. tâˆ’Ï„can be thought of as the age of
 the particle. The particles labeled ( Î±, Ï„) form a circle of radius Ï(Î±, Ï„) at a height z(Î±, Ï„)
 above the z= 0 plane.

 Fig. 1 describes the caustic ring cross-section. Fig. 1(a) p lots (Ï(Î±, Ï„), z(Î±, Ï„)) for contin-
 uousÏ„, and discrete values of Î±. The lines in Fig. 1(a) are the trajectories of the particles
 forming the ï¬‚ow, except that positions are plotted as a funct ion of age, whereas for ordinary
 trajectories position is plotted as a function of time. Let u s call the lines of Fig. 1(a) â€œage
 trajectoriesâ€. Fig. 1(a) shows that particle density diver ges on a closed line which has the
 shape of a isosceles triangle, but with cusps instead of angl es. We call that shape aâ€œtricuspâ€.
 The location of the tricusp is shown in Fig. 1(b) for the ï¬‚ow of Fig. 1(a). It is the envelope
 of the age trajectories. There are four ï¬‚ows everywhere insi de the tricusp and two ï¬‚ows
 everywhere outside. The caustic, i.e. the surface where the density diverges, lies at the
 boundary between the region with four ï¬‚ows and the region wit h two ï¬‚ows.

 One of the cusps of the tricusp points away from the galactic c enter.
 Consider the 3-dim. space spanned by the two physical coordi nates Ïandzplus the
 constant Ï„0.Ï„0can be positive or negative. In ( Ï, z, Ï„ 0) space, the tricusp is perpendicular to
 theÏ„0axis with one cusp pointing in the positive Ïdirection. As Ï„0varies from negative to
 positive values, the size of the tricusp, which varies as Ï„2
 0, shrinks to zero and then increases
 again. The structure in the neighborhood of Ï„0= 0 is the (full) elliptic umbilic catastrophe
 (Dâˆ’4), one of the elementary catastrophes in three dimensions. T hus the tricusp, i.e. the
 cross-section of a caustic ring, is a section of the elliptic umbilic.
 If the z-axis is rescaled relative to the Ï-axis so as to make the tricusp equilateral, the
 tricusp has a Z3symmetry [15] consisting of rotations by multiples of2Ï€
 3about the point of
 coordinates ( Ïc, zc) = (a+p/4,0). This point may thus be called the center of the tricusp. It
 is indicated by a star in Fig. 1(b). As an example of how the abo ve formalism is to be used,
 let us derive a formula for the density dcat the center of the tricusp. Using Eqs. (1), one ï¬nds
 that the four ï¬‚ows there have parameter values ( Î±, Ï„) = (0 ,3

 In obtaining this result, we approximated Ïbyaand cos Î±by 1 in Eq. (2), and neglected
 theÎ±-dependence ofdM
 dâ„¦dÏ„. These approximations are appropriate since we assume that p
 andqare small relative to a. For the mass per unit length enclosed within the tricusp, we
 ï¬nd by numerical integration
 Î»= 0.6pqdc. (6)
 Note that some of the mass associated with the caustic ring li es outside the tricusp. In
 particular, when p=q= 0, Î»= 0 but there is still a caustic ring and an associated
 overdensity. In that limit, the tricusp has collapsed to a po int, and the particle density
 diverges as the inverse distance to that point [15].
 5Finally, we describe the velocities of the particles that co nstitute the caustic ring. Let us
 write the velocity of particle labeled ( Î±, Ï„) as/vector v(Î±, Ï„) =vÏ†(Î±, Ï„)Ë†Ï†+vÏ(Î±, Ï„)Ë†Ï+vz(Î±, Ï„)Ë†z. For
 p, qâ‰ªa, all the particles in the caustic have the same speed vbecause they have come to the
 caustic from a small region (near the equator) of the turnaro und sphere, along neighboring
 trajectories. The main component of velocity is in the Ë†Ï†direction: vÏ†â‰ƒv. The speed vis

 âˆ‚Ï„=âˆ’u(Ï„âˆ’Ï„0), v z=âˆ’âˆ‚z
 âˆ‚Ï„=âˆ’bÎ± . (8)
 Here we use the fact that, in case of stationary ï¬‚ow, the parti cle positions are func-
 tions only of their age tâˆ’Ï„. For the four ï¬‚ows within the tricusp, vÏandvzare

 Caustic rings grow in mass and radius on cosmological time sc ales, implying that the ï¬‚ow
 is not exactly stationary. However, provided one has inform ation on the manner in which
 the growth occurs, the time dependence is easily included. F or example, if the growth in
 size is tantamount to an increase in the caustic radius at the rate Ë™a, the velocities are still
 as described in the previous paragraph except vÏis replaced with vÏ+ Ë™a. If the growth is

 Thus far, we have given a detailed description of a caustic ri ng in the limit of axial
 symmetry and where the transverse sizes pandqof the ring are much smaller than its
 radius a. The description is in terms of a small number of parameters: a, b, u, Ï„ 0, sand
 dM
 dâ„¦dÏ„. We now turn to the self-similar model of galactic halo forma tion to obtain estimates
 of these parameters for the caustic rings in actual halos.
 B. Predictions of the self-similar infall model
 The self-similar model of galactic halo formation [19, 20, 2 1] assumes that the entire halo
 phase space distribution is unchanged in time except for a re scaling of all lengths by a scale
 factor R(t), and all velocities byR(t)
 twhere tis cosmic time. Physical space densities scale
 as1
 t2. A spherically symmetric overdensity in an Einstein-de Sit ter universe (â„¦ matter = 1)
 has self-similar evolution provided its initial proï¬le is a power law [19, 20]

 where Miis the mass interior to initial radius ri,Î´Miis the corresponding extra mass, and
 Ç«is a parameter with the a-priori range 0 â‰¤Ç«â‰¤1. The scale factor R(t) is proportional to
 t2
 3+2
 9Ç«. The rotation curve is ï¬‚at at small rprovided 0 â‰¤Ç«â‰¤2
 3[19]. In an average sense, Ç«is
 related to the slope of the power spectrum of density perturb ations on galactic scales [23].
 The standard CDM power spectrum implies Ç«is in the range 0.2 to 0.35 [21].
 6The accelerated expansion [24] of the universe is not consis tent with Einstein-de Sitter
 cosmology, nor therefore with strict self-similarity. Thi s is not a serious shortcoming of
 the self-similar model, however, because galactic halos we re formed for the most part long
 before the onset of accelerated expansion, when the univers e was accurately described by
 Einstein-de Sitter cosmology.
 The original spherically symmetric self-similar model [19 , 20] assumes radial orbits for
 all the particles. Whereas this approximation is reasonabl e when describing the outer parts
 of a galactic halo, it is inadequate for the inner parts. Spec iï¬cally, in the approximation of
 radial orbits, all particles pass through the galactic cent er each time they fall in and out of
 the galaxy, causing the density to diverge at the center as1
 r2. The halo contribution to the
 rotation curve then approaches a constant as râ†’0. In actual galaxies, the central parts
 are dominated by baryons, and the halo contribution to the ro tation curve goes to zero at
 the center.
 However, the self-similar model can be generalized [21] to a llow the dark matter particles
 to have angular momentum. Self-similarity is maintained pr ovided the speciï¬c angular
 momentum distribution on the turnaround sphere at time tis of the form:
 /vectorâ„“(Ë†r, t) =/vectorj(Ë†r)R2(t)
 t, (10)
 where R(t) is the turnaround radius and /vectorj(Ë†r) is a dimensionless and time-independent an-
 gular momentum distribution. When angular momentum is incl uded, particle orbits avoid
 the galactic center, the inner parts of the halo are depleted , and the halo contribution to the
 rotation curve goes to zero at r= 0, as it should. In the Milky Way, approximately half of
 the rotation velocity squared at our location is due to dark m atter, and half is due to bary-
 onic matter. This determines the average magnitude Â¯jof the rescaled angular momentum
 distribution /vectorj(Ë†r) to be of order Â¯jâˆ¼0.2 for the Milky Way halo [21].
 The caustic rings of dark matter occur where the particles wi th the most angular momen-
 tum are at their distance of closest approach to the galactic center [15, 18]. In the spherically
 symmetric model, the orbits are radial and hence the distanc e of closest approach vanishes
 for all particles. In that case all the caustic rings collaps e to a single caustic point at the
 center of spherical symmetry. In the more realistic self-si milar model with angular momen-
 tum, the caustic rings have ï¬nite radii. The radii are predic ted in terms of the maximum
 value jmaxof the dimensionless angular momentum distribution /vectorj(Ë†r) [13]:

 0.25/parenrightbigg
 (11)
 where vrotis the rotation velocity of the galaxy. Eq. (11) is for the par ticular case Ç«= 0.3.
 However, the anâˆ1
 napproximate behaviour holds for all Ç«in the relevant range 0 .2â‰¤Ç«â‰¤
 0.35, so that a change in Ç«can be compensated for, as far as the anvalues are concerned,
 by a change in jmax. We will assume Ç«= 0.3 henceforth. The self-similar model does not
 predict jmaxand allows a diï¬€erent jmaxvalue for each galactic halo.
 The relationship between Â¯jandjmaxdepends, of course, on the /vectorj(Ë†r) distribution. Let us
 assume the simplest distribution consistent with net overa ll rotation and axial symmetry:
 /vectorj(Ë†r) =jmaxË†Ï†cosÎ±, i.e. that the turnaround sphere is initially rigidly rotat ing. In that case,
 Â¯j=Ï€
 4jmax. Thus, for the Milky Way halo, the estimate Â¯jâˆ¼0.2 implies jmaxâˆ¼0.25.
 In summary so far, the self similar infall model with axial sy mmetry and net overall
 rotation predicts caustic rings in the galactic plane at the radii speciï¬ed in Eq. (11). It also

 Eqs. (13) and (14) provide the prefactor which appears in the formulas for the density
 [Eqs. (2) and (5)], up to the ratiov
 b, which is of order one but which may diï¬€er from one by
 a factor two or so. The transverse sizes, pandq, of the caustic rings and the ratiov
 bdepend
 on relatively more subtle properties of the velocity distri bution at last turnaround [15], and
 are not predicted by the self-similar infall model.
 Observational evidence has been found in support of Eq. (11) in the Milky Way and other
 spiral galaxies. We brieï¬‚y describe this evidence now.
 C. Summary of observational evidence
 Caustic rings of dark matter in or near the galactic plane cau se bumps in the galactic
 rotation curve. In ref. [22] a set of 32 extended and well-mea sured rotation curves was
 analyzed to test the hypothesis that some of their bumps are c aused by caustic rings of dark
 matter at the radii given by Eq. (11). For each rotation curve , the radial coordinate rwas
 rescaled according to
 râ†’Ëœr=r/parenleftBigg220 km /s
 vrot/parenrightBigg
 , (15)
 where vrotis the rotation velocity implied by the curve. The rotation c urves were then co-
 added. The combined rotation curve shows peaks at Ëœ râ‰ƒ20 and 40 kpc, with a signiï¬cance
 of 2.6 Ïƒand 3.0 Ïƒrespectively. The result suggests not only the existence of caustic rings
 of dark matter at the radii given by Eq. (11), but also that the distribution of jmaxvalues is
 peaked near jmaxâ‰ƒ0.27.
 The Milky Way rotation curve has a series of sharp rises at rad ii which agree at the 3%
 level [12] with the caustic ring radii given in Eq. (11). The i nner North Galactic rotation
 curve of ref. [25] has ten rises between r= 3 and 8.5 kpc, which may be identiï¬ed with
 caustic rings n= 5,6...14. The rises are â€œsharpâ€ in the sense that they start and end
 with discontinuities (kinks) in the slope of the rotation cu rve. Kinks in the rotation curve
 are predicted by caustic rings because the dark matter densi ty diverges at the caustic. The
 outer Milky Way rotation curve is much less well measured. No netheless it has a prominent
 rise near r= 13 kpc which may be identiï¬ed with the n= 3 caustic ring. Finally, the
 IRAS map of the Galactic plane in the direction of galactic co ordinates ( l, b) = (80â—¦,0â—¦)
 has a triangular feature whose position and appearance is co nsistent with the imprint of the
 caustic ring of dark matter nearest to us ( n= 5) upon the gas and dust in the disk.
 8D. Expectations for the n= 2caustic ring
 Eq. (11) predicts that the n= 2 caustic ring has radius a2â‰ƒ20 kpc. Eq. (12) predicts that
 the speed of the particles constituting the ring is approxim ately 515 km/s. The transverse
 sizesp2andq2are not predicted. However, it is reasonable to expect that t hen= 2 caustic
 ring has properties similar to caustic rings n= 3 and n= 5 to 14, for which we have the
 observational evidence mentioned in the previous subsecti on. The pvalues of those rings can
 be read oï¬€ from the widths of the corresponding rises in the Mi lky Way rotation curve [12].
 For those â€œobservedâ€ rings, one ï¬nds that p/aranges from 0.015 to 0.1, with an average
 value of 0.05. We thus expect p2to be of order 1 kpc, and very likely between 0.3 and 2
 kpc. The rises in the rotation curve do not inform us about the values of q. However, the

 III. EFFECT OF A CAUSTIC RING OF DARK MATTER UPON BARYONIC
 MATTER IN THE DISK
 In this section, we ï¬rst describe the gravitational ï¬eld of a caustic ring of dark matter
 and its eï¬€ect on the Galactic rotation curve, assuming that t he caustic ring lies in the plane
 of the disk. Next we identify two possible mechanisms by whic h a ring of stars may form
 due to the presence of a caustic ring of dark matter. The ï¬rst m echanism is the migration
 of gas to the caustic ring radius, leading to enhanced star fo rmation there. The second is
 the adiabatic deformation of star orbits as the caustic ring slowly grows in size.
 A. Gravitational ï¬eld of a caustic ring
 As before, we assume that the transverse dimensions, pandq, of the caustic ring are
 small compared to its radius a. In that limit, when calculating the gravitational ï¬eld /vector gof
 the caustic ring at a distance of order porqfrom the ring, we may neglect its curvature and
 pretend that it is a straight tube. Then
 /vector gc(Ï, z) =âˆ’2G/integraldisplay
 dÏâ€²dzâ€²d(Ïâ€², zâ€²)(Ïâˆ’Ïâ€², zâˆ’zâ€²)
 (Ïâˆ’Ïâ€²)2+ (zâˆ’zâ€²)2. (18)
 9Using Eq. (2), changing variables ( Ïâ€², zâ€²)â†’(Î±, Ï„), neglecting the ( Î±, Ï„) dependence of
 dM
 dâ„¦dÏ„(Î±, Ï„) over the size of the caustic, and approximating cos Î±â‰ƒ1, we obtain
 /vector gc(Ï, z) =âˆ’2G

 (Ïâˆ’Ï(Î±, Ï„))2+ (zâˆ’z(Î±, Ï„))2. (19)
 Eqs. (1) provide the functions Ï(Î±, Ï„) and z(Î±, Ï„). The integral on the RHS of Eq. (19) may
 be evaluated numerically for all Ïandz. In the galactic plane
 /vector gc(r,0) =âˆ’8Ï€G

 A plot of I(1, X) is shown in Fig. 2(a). I(1, X) has an upward kink at X= 0 and a
 downward kink at X= 1. The kinks are due to the divergent behaviour of the dark ma tter
 density in the z= 0 plane at r=aandr=a+p. The shape of I(Î¶, X) with Î¶âˆne}ationslash= 1 is
 similar to that of I(1, X). The amount âˆ† I(Î¶) by which I(Î¶, X) rises between X= 0 and
 X= 1 depends on Î¶. A plot of âˆ† I(Î¶) is given in ref. [15]. âˆ† I(Î¶) is near one for Î¶of order
 one, and âˆ† I(1) = 1.
 Substituting Eq. (13) into Eq. (20), we obtain:
 /vector gc(r,0) =âˆ’2fv2

 Sincev2

 ris the gravitational ï¬eld of the galaxy as a whole, andv
 bandI(Î¶,râˆ’a
 p) are both
 of order one whereas fis of order a few %, Eq. (23) implies that the caustic ring of da rk
 matter causes only a small perturbation on the local gravita tional ï¬eld.
 Consider a smooth halo which produces a ï¬‚at rotation curve wi th rotation velocity vrot.
 If we add to the halo a caustic ring of dark matter of radius a, t he gravitational ï¬eld near
 r=awould be /vector g(/vector r) =âˆ’g(r)Ë†rwith
 g(r) =v2
 rot
 r[1 + 2fv
 bI(Î¶,râˆ’a
 p)]. (24)
 However, this is not what we want to do. Indeed, the caustic ri ng of dark matter is not an
 addition to the smooth halo. Rather, it is the outcome of redistributing dark matter already
 present in the halo. One can see that it is incorrect merely to add caustic rings of dark
 10matter to a smooth halo by noting that this would cause the rot ation curve to rise. The
 rotation velocity squared would rise by the relative amount 2fnvn
 bnâˆ†I(Î¶n) at the nth ring,
 for each ring. Instead, the redistribution of dark matter in to caustic rings should be such
 that the rotation curve remains ï¬‚at on average. The gravitat ional ï¬eld in the vicinity of a
 caustic ring is therefore of the form
 g(r) =v2
 rot
 r/parenleftBigg
 1 + 2fv
 b[I(Î¶,râˆ’a

 (25)
 where H(r) is a smooth function which steps down by the amount âˆ† I(Î¶) asrincreases from
 râ‰ªatorâ‰«a; for example, H(r) =âˆ’1
 2âˆ†I(Î¶) tanh(râˆ’a

 Let us deï¬ne

 The gravitational ï¬eld in the galactic plane near a caustic r ing of dark matter is then

 r[1 + 2fJ(râˆ’a)]. (27)
 Fig. 2(b) shows what the function J(râˆ’a) looks like qualitatively.

 Unless â„¦ is r-independent (rigid rotation) there is shear in the velocit y ï¬eld. The viscous
 forces which result from this shear cause radial motion of th e gas, as discussed by Lynden-
 Bell and Pringle [28]. For the sake of completeness, we repea t here relevant considerations
 from ref. [28].
 Consider a cylinder of radius r. The viscous force per unit area across the cylinder is
 ÏÎ½rdâ„¦
 drwhere Ïis the gas density and Î½its viscosity. Hence, the viscous torque across the
 cylinder is
 Ï„= 2Ï€r/integraldisplay

 dr)r= 2Ï€Î½Ïƒr3dâ„¦
 dr(29)
 where Ïƒ=/integraltextdz Ïis the mass per unit surface of the gas. Consider an annulus of width Î´r.
 Its mass is Î´m= 2Ï€rÎ´rÏƒ . The torque on the annulus is
 Ï„(r+Î´r)âˆ’Ï„(r) =Î´rd
 dr(2Ï€Î½Ïƒr3dâ„¦
 dr) =d

 where Î´L=Î´mâ„¦(r)r2is its angular momentum, andd
 dt=âˆ‚
 âˆ‚t+vrâˆ‚
 âˆ‚ris the time derivative
 â€œfollowing the motionâ€. We haved Î´m
 dt= 0. Also,âˆ‚
 âˆ‚t[â„¦(r)r2] = 0 because the gravitational
 ï¬eld is determined by the mass distribution of the Galaxy as a whole and only negligibly
 altered by the motion of the gas. We thus obtain
 vr=1
 Ïƒrd

 11for the radial velocity of the gas. The gas obeys the continui ty equation
 âˆ‚Ïƒ
 âˆ‚t+1
 râˆ‚
 âˆ‚r(rvrÏƒ) = 0 . (32)
 Eq. (31) neglects the back-reaction pressure from the accum ulation of gas at particular radii.
 Let us assume that the gas is distributed uniformly (dÏƒ
 dr=dÎ½
 dr= 0) to start with, and use
 Eq. (31) to determine in which direction it is driven by the vi scous forces. In a smooth halo
 with ï¬‚at rotation curve, â„¦ =vrot
 rand hence vr=âˆ’Î½
 r. If a caustic ring of dark matter lies in
 the disk, we have instead in the neighborhood of the ring
 â„¦(r) =vrot
 r[1 + 2fJ(râˆ’a)]1
 2=vrot
 r[1 +fJ(râˆ’a) + 0(f2)]. (33)
 Inserting Eq. (33) into Eq. (31), settingdÏƒ
 dr=dÎ½
 dr= 0, and neglecting terms of order f2, we
 obtain
 vr=âˆ’Î½

 Eq. (37) shows that, within the tricusp, the gas velocity is a lso inward but much larger, by
 a factor three or more, than outside the tricusp. It increase s rapidly as râ†’a+. Therefore
 the viscous forces tend to drive the gas towards r=a. This happens on gas dynamic time
 scales which are much shorter than the cosmological time sca les over which the caustic rings
 migrate. The accumulation of gas at the caustic ring radius m ay lead to enhanced star
 formation there. Such processes may be at work in the case of t he Monoceros Ring. To
 the extent that such processes dominate the formation of the Monoceros Ring, the stars in
 the Ring should be younger than average. Ref. [26] presents e vidence that Monoceros Ring
 stars are on average bluer and therefore younger than ordina ry disk stars.
 C. Eï¬€ect on star orbits
 In this subsection, we consider the adiabatic deformation o f disk star orbits by the slowly
 growing caustic ring of dark matter.
 121. Collision rate
 Adiabatic deformation of star orbits presupposes that the s tar collision rate is small. The
 time scale over which star orbits are signiï¬cantly modiï¬ed t hrough gravitational scattering
 with other stars in a population is [27]
 trelaxâ‰ƒ0.3Ïƒ3

 where nis the density of stars in the population, mtheir typical mass, Ïƒtheir velocity
 dispersion, and lnÎ› â‰ƒ20. For the stars in the Monoceros Ring, trelaxâˆ¼1016yr if we set
 mâˆ¼MâŠ™,Ïƒâˆ¼20 km/s, and nâˆ¼10âˆ’3/pc3. Since trelaxis much greater that the age of the
 universe, we are justiï¬ed in neglecting collisions among st ars in the Ring.

 Since we expect pâ€²to be of order aand at any rate much larger than faâˆ¼1
 20a, we ï¬nd
 that circular orbits are stable everywhere in the neighborh ood of a circular caustic ring of
 dark matter. The conclusion is valid only if the caustic ring is circular, because lack of axial
 symmetry may drive an instability through the phenomenon of Lindblad resonance, as we
 now discuss.

 Let us caution that these estimates take account only of the g ravitational force exerted
 by the caustic ring of dark matter itself, and neglect the gra vity of the baryons that have
 aggregated at the caustic.

 Fig. 3 shows râ€²(r, a) as a function of a. Each line in that ï¬gure corresponds to a diï¬€erent
 value of r. Let Ï(r) be the density of stars in the absence of the caustic, and Ïâ€²(r, a) their
 density in the presence of a caustic with radius a. Assuming that all stars are and remain
 on circular orbits, conservation of the number of stars impl ies

 Ïâ€²(r, a) =Ï/bracketleftBigg
 1 + 2f J(râˆ’a) +frdJ

 (55)
 where Ïis the initial density. The second term in brackets is an orde r 10 % modulation of
 the initial density. The third term is of order f, like the second term, but diverges when
 râ†’a+as 1/âˆšrâˆ’a. It has the same singularity structure at râ†’a+as the dark matter
 density because gâ€²(r) =v2
 rot
 r[1 + 2f J(r)] satisï¬es Gaussâ€²law. Eq. (55) states that, in the
 limit where all stars are on circular orbits, the star densit y adopts at r=a+the same
 divergent proï¬le as the dark matter in the caustic surface th ere. The pile-up of circular
 orbits at r=a+is clearly seen in Fig. 3.
 4. Non circular orbits
 The observed radial velocity dispersion âˆ† vof stars in the Monoceros Ring is of order 20
 km/s. This implies that the stars do not move on circular orbi ts, but oscillate in the radial

 Eq. (54) averaged over the length scale âˆ† r. The sharp features at r=aandr=a+pare

 stars at the n= 2 caustic ring of dark matter, announced earlier.
 For the proposed interpretation of the Monoceros Ring, the r adial velocities acquired by
 stars as a result of the passing of a caustic ring should be les s than the measured radial
 velocity dispersion of stars in the Monoceros Ring. We now ve rify that this is the case.
 The radial motion of a star in a near circular orbit in the neig hborhood of a caustic ring
 is that of a harmonic oscillator whose equilibrium position isrâ€²(r(l), a(t)) and whose proper
 frequency Ï‰is given by Eq. (40) evaluated at râ€².a(t) is a smooth function of time. However,
 as shown in Fig. 3, râ€²as a function of ahas kinks at a=râ€²anda=râ€²âˆ’p. The velocitydrâ€²

 of the equilibrium position changes abruptly when it passes the caustic at those locations.
 A star in circular orbit in the z= 0 plane ï¬rst encounters the caustic at râ€²=a+p. For
 illustrative purposes, we consider the case a= 20 kpc, t0= 13.7 Gyr, Ç«= 0.3,p= 1 kpc,
 v=bandf= 0.046. The caustic moves with outward speed

 16IV. CONCLUSIONS
 The ï¬‚ow of cold collisionless dark matter in and out of the gra vitational potential of
 a galaxy necessarily forms inner and outer caustics. The inn er caustics are rings in the
 galactic plane provided the angular momentum distribution of the infalling dark matter is
 characterized by net overall rotation. Assuming self-simi lar infall, the radii of the caustic
 rings of dark matter in our galaxy were predicted to be 40 kpc/ nwithn= 1, 2, 3 ... Because
 the Monoceros Ring of stars is located near the second causti c ring of dark matter we looked
 for processes by which the latter may cause the former.
 We have identiï¬ed two such processes. The ï¬rst is the ï¬‚ow of ga s in the disk towards the
 sharp angular velocity minimum located at the caustic ring r adius, increasing the rate of
 star formation there. To the extent that this process is resp onsible for the formation of the
 Monoceros Ring, the Ring stars are predicted to be bluer than average. The second process
 is the adiabatic deformation of star orbits in the neighborh ood of the caustic ring. As the
 spatial dependence of the gravitational ï¬eld of a caustic ri ng is known, it is straightforward
 to obtain the map of initial to ï¬nal orbits for disk stars. The resulting enhancement of
 disk star density at the location of the second caustic ring i s of order 100%. Because of
 uncertainties in the caustic parametersv
 bandp, and in the velocity distribution of the disk
 stars, the strength of the enhancement can only be estimated within a factor of two or so.
 The self similar infall model of galactic halo formation is e xpected to describe the halos
 of all isolated spiral galaxies. The caustic rings of dark ma tter in exterior galaxies may also
 be revealed by the baryonic matter they attract. Our analyis is relevant to those cases as
 well.
 The existence of caustics has implications for most approac hes to the detection of dark
 matter, including direct searches of WIMPs [29] and axions [ 30], the gamma ray signal from
 WIMP annihilation [31], and gravitational lensing [32].

 FIG. 1: (a) Dark matter trajectories forming a caustic ring o f dark matter, in Ïâˆ’zcross-section.
 (b) The envelope of the trajectories shown in (a). We refer to the shape shown in (b) as the
 â€œtricuspâ€. The ï¬gure also indicates what is meant by the radi usaof a caustic ring, and by its
 transverse sizes pandq. The star indicates the center of the tricusp, as deï¬ned in th e text.

 20FIG. 3: The radii râ€²(r,a) of circular orbits in the presence of a caustic, as a functio n of the caustic
 radius a.ris the radius of the orbit in the absence of caustic. Each line corresponds to a diï¬€erent
 value of r. Each line has an upward kink at râ€²=a+pand a downward kink at râ€²=a. As a
 increases with pï¬xed, râ€²ï¬rst decreases from its initial value runtilrâ€²=a+p. Fora < râ€²< a+p,
 i.e. when the orbit is within the tricusp, râ€²increases with abut not as fast as a, until a=râ€². As
 aincreases yet further râ€²(r,a) returns to the value rfrom which it started. Note that the radii of
 circular orbits pile up at r=a. Stars on approximately circular orbits oscillate about râ€²(r,a).
