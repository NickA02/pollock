 Abstract
 With an aim towards understanding the time-dependence of en tanglement entropy
 in generic quantum ï¬eld theories, we propose a covariant gen eralization of the holo-
 graphic entanglement entropy proposal of hep-th/0603001 . Apart from providing sev-
 eral examples of possible covariant generalizations, we st udy a particular construction
 based on light-sheets, motivated in similar spirit to the co variant entropy bound under-
 lying the holographic principle. In particular, we argue th at the entanglement entropy
 associated with a speciï¬ed region on the boundary in the cont ext of the AdS/CFT
 correspondence is given by the area of a co-dimension two bul k surface with vanishing
 expansions of null geodesics. We demonstrate our construct ion with several exam-
 ples to illustrate its reduction to the holographic entangl ement entropy proposal in
 static spacetimes. We further show how this proposal may be u sed to understand
 the time evolution of entanglement entropy in a time varying QFT state dual to a
 collapsing black hole background. Finally, we use our propo sal to argue that the Eu-
 clidean wormhole geometries with multiple boundaries shou ld be regarded as states in
 a non-interacting but entangled set of QFTs, one associated to each boundary.

 21 Introduction
 One of the important questions in quantum ï¬eld theories is to understand the number
 of operative degrees of freedom in the theory at a given scale . In conventional RG parlance
 this is measured by the Zamolodchikovâ€™s c-function (in two d imensions) [ 1] which at the
 critical points takes on the value of the central charge. One believes this picture to persist in
 higher dimensions; in particular, there ought to exist some analog of a c-function in higher
 dimensional quantum ï¬eld theories of interest. Clearly the re is a well-deï¬ned notion of the
 central charges for conformal ï¬eld theories in d >2 [2], which may quantify the total degrees
 of freedom. However, this interpretation in terms of the deg rees of freedom has not yet been
 rigorously proved except in two dimensions. Measuring degr ees of freedom in time-dependent
 backgrounds is an especially important open problem. A deta iled understanding of this
 issue is very important for making precise the notion of holo graphy in quantum gravity. For
 example, in the context of string theory in unstable backgro unds with closed string tachyons,
 one expects that as the tachyon condenses, the number of degr ees of freedom does change
 [3]; to verify this expectation it is crucial to have a precise n otion of the time-dependent
 degrees of freedom.
 A simple way to get a measure of the degrees of freedom is to cou ple the system to a
 heat bath and study its thermal properties, in particular it s entropy. However, we could also
 ask the equally important question: suppose we concentrate on a particular region of the
 background spacetime on which the QFT is deï¬ned and ask what i s the correct measure of
 the operative degrees of freedom in that region (even at zero temperature). One important
 aspect of this is captured by the entanglement entropy, whic h provides a measure of how the
 degrees of freedom localized in that region interact (are â€œe ntangledâ€) with the rest of the
 theory. In a sense the entanglement entropy is a measure of th e eï¬€ective operative degrees
 of freedom, i.e., those that are active participants in the dynamics, in a giv en region of the
 background geometry. Refer to [ 4] for a short review of entanglement entropy in QFT.
 Consider a QFT deï¬ned on a spacetime manifold âˆ‚M(the peculiar choice of notation for
 the background will become clear momentarily), and assume t hatâˆ‚Mallows the foliation
 by time-slices âˆ‚Ntasâˆ‚M=âˆ‚NtÃ—Rt. We wish to focus on a region AtâŠ‚âˆ‚Ntat a ï¬xed
 timet. Denote also the complement of Atwith respect to âˆ‚NtbyBtso that Atâˆª Bt=âˆ‚Nt.
 This procedure divides the Hilbert space for the total syste mHinto a direct product of two
 Hilbert spaces HAandHBfor the two subsystems, corresponding to the regions AtandBt,
 respectively, i.e.,Htot=HAâŠ— HB. In this setup, one measure of the number of degrees of
 freedom associated with region (or sub-system) Atis given by the entanglement entropy SAt.
 It is deï¬ned as the von Neumann entropy SAt(t) =âˆ’TrÏAt(t) logÏAt(t) associated with the
 reduced density matrix ÏAt(t) = Tr BÏtot(t), obtained by taking a trace of the density matrix
 Ïtot(t) for the total system at time tover the Hilbert space HB. Notice that the entanglement
 entropy deï¬ned in this way is manifestly time-dependent. Be low, we will suppress the index
 twhich shows the time-dependence when we consider a static sy stem, where SAt(t) does not
 3depend on t.
 In the same way, we can deï¬ne the entanglement entropy SBt(t) for the other subsystem
 Bt. In general, SAt(t) is diï¬€erent from SBt(t). However, they are equivalent if the total system
 is described by a pure state |Î¨(t)âˆa\}bâˆ‡acketâˆ‡i}ht=|Î¨Atâˆa\}bâˆ‡acketâˆ‡i}htâŠ— |Î¨Btâˆa\}bâˆ‡acketâˆ‡i}ht, where the total and reduced density
 matrices are given by Ïtot(t) =|Î¨(t)âˆa\}bâˆ‡acketâˆ‡i}htâˆa\}bâˆ‡acketle{tÎ¨(t)|andÏAt(t) = Tr Bt|Î¨(t)âˆa\}bâˆ‡acketâˆ‡i}htâˆa\}bâˆ‡acketle{tÎ¨(t)|, respectively.
 In a two dimensional CFT, we can analytically calculate the e ntanglement entropy for
 arbitrary choice of the subsystem Atas shown recently in [ 5], generalizing the previously
 known result [ 6]. Moreover, an analogue of the Zamolodchikovâ€™s c-theorem ( called entropic
 c-theorem) has been shown in [ 7,8] (see also [ 9]). However, in higher dimensions it is rather
 diï¬ƒcult to obtain analytical results for generic At. Its state of the art is reviewed in [ 10]
 from the viewpoint of the QFT.
 Recently, entanglement entropies of various 1+1 and 2+1 dim ensional condensed matter
 systems have been actively investigated in order to underst and zero temperature quantum
 phase transitions [ 11,4,12,13,14]. In this context, entanglement entropy plays an important
 role of an order parameter of the phase transition. For examp le, in a material exhibiting
 topological ordering, such as the system with anyons in frac tional quantum Hall eï¬€ect,
 correlation functions are not useful since the theory is top ological. Instead we need a quantity
 which probes non-local information like fractional statis tics of anyons. It turns out that the
 entanglement entropy can do this job elegantly, because it i s deï¬ned non-locally [ 12,13,14].
 As already mentioned, one of the important reasons to be inte rested in issues related to
 measuring degrees of freedom has to do with quantum gravity a nd the notion of holography.
 Roughly speaking, the holographic principle states that th e number of degrees of freedom
 in a quantum theory of gravity scales with the area of the syst em, in contrast to standard
 QFTs where the entropy is extensive and scales with the volum e [15,16,17]. In string
 theory a natural realization of the holographic principle i s manifested by the AdS/CFT
 correspondence [ 18,19] which gives us a precise map between a quantum gravity theor y on
 an asymptotically AdS spacetime Mand an ordinary QFT on the conformal boundary âˆ‚M
 ofM. In this context we can ask whether there is a gravitational d ual of the entanglement
 entropy associated with a subsystem of the boundary QFT. Ref er to [ 20,21] for earlier
 pioneering works.
 Interestingly, for a long time it has been known that the lead ing ultraviolet divergent
 contribution to the entanglement entropy SAin QFTs is proportional to the area of the
 boundary âˆ‚Aof the subsystem A(known as the area law of entanglement entropy) [ 22,23].
 This means that unlike the thermal entropy, the entanglemen t entropy is not an extensive
 quantity.1Instead, this property looks very analogous to the holograp hic principle and the
 area law of Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy. This fac t strongly suggests a simple
 1For systems at ï¬nite temperature, the entanglement entropy also includes a ï¬nite extensive term which
 is proportional to the thermal entropy.
 4gravitational interpretation of entanglement entropy in Q FTs via a holographic relation.
 Recently, a geometric procedure has been discovered to comp ute the entanglement en-
 tropy of a sub-system A âŠ‚âˆ‚Nin the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence [ 24,10].
 The construction which we review in Â§2proceeds as follows: given a region Ainâˆ‚N(at
 a ï¬xed time) of a static asymptotically AdS spacetime, we con struct a minimal surface S
 (i.e., a surface whose area takes the minimum value) in the bulk spa cetime Mwhich is
 anchored at the boundary âˆ‚AofA. The area of this minimal surface in the bulk Planck
 units provides an accurate measure of the entanglement of th e degrees of freedom in Awith
 those in its spatial complement, B. This prescription has been veriï¬ed by several non-trivial
 checks [ 24,10,25,3,26] as well as a direct proof [ 27]. This holographic prescription provides
 a simple way to calculate the entanglement entropy in spacet imes with no temporal evo-
 lution. Moreover, this holographic relation is successful ly applied to the brane-world black
 holes [ 28,29] and de-Sitter spaces [ 30] as well, which enable us to interpret the horizon
 entropy with quantum corrections as the entanglement entro py (see also recent discussions
 [31,32,33]).
 The geometric perspective provided by the minimal surface c onstruction has many ad-
 vantages, especially for QFTs in dimensions d >2, since there are relatively few techniques
 to calculate the entanglement entropy in interacting ï¬eld t heories. Furthermore, herein lies
 the hope to address an interesting question related to entan glement entropy, namely its be-
 haviour as a function of time in an interacting QFT. In this co ntext it is important to note
 that since the entanglement entropy is not an extensive quan tity, unlike the conventional
 thermodynamic entropy, a priori it does not have to obey the Second Law. Nevertheless, it
 seems natural to expect that when we consider an interacting QFT, the degrees of freedom
 in region Awill interact with those in Band consequently get more entangled, thereby in-
 creasing the entanglement entropy SA. Indeed the following theorem is well-known: let Î› t
 (tâˆˆR+) be a one parameter family of positive linear transformatio ns of a Hilbert space H
 such that they constitute a semi-group2; then S(Î›t(Ï))â‰¥S(Ï). This â€œmonotonicityâ€ prop-
 erty essentially comes from the concavity of âˆ’ÏlogÏas a function of Ï. In the setup of this
 theorem, we interpret Î› tas the irreversible and non-unitary time-evolution such as a quan-
 tum analogue of the Markov process. Also Ïis taken to be the reduced density matrix ÏA.
 On the other hand, in the case of a unitary time evolution of an excited state, the entropy
 for the total system remains the same while the entanglement entropy for a subsystem can
 change. Explicit examples are borne out in the analysis of [ 34] where the authors analyse
 the situation in two dimensional ï¬eld theories. However, th e general story is far from clear
 and one would like to get a better handle on the problem. Hence , instead of examining
 time-dependence of entanglement entropy from the QFT point of view, we would like to
 2Here a positive matrix is deï¬ned to be a Hermitian matrix whos e trace is positive. A positive linear
 transformation is the one which maps a positive matrix to ano ther positive matrix. Also we require that it
 does not change the identity and satisï¬es Tr Î› t(Ï) = Tr Ïfor any density matrix on H.
 5analyse it using the holographic prescription mentioned ab ove.
 In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the prescript ion for calculating the en-
 tanglement entropy from the area of a minimal surface suï¬€ers from one stumbling block: the
 minimal surfaces are usually associated with Euclidean geo metries. In Lorentzian spacetimes
 one has trouble deï¬ning a minimal surface, because by wiggli ng a spacelike surface in the
 time direction, one can make its area arbitrarily small. For static spacetimes, this problem
 is usually avoided by Wick rotating and working in the Euclid ean set-up, or equivalently by
 restricting attention to a constant time slice. But for the m ost interesting, dynamical ques-
 tions, this method is not applicable. However, this does not necessarily mean that the notion
 of the geometric dual of the entanglement entropy cannot be d eï¬ned in general. Indeed, as
 we have explicitly seen, entanglement entropy is well-deï¬n ed in terms of the time-dependent
 density matrix, and therefore has to admit a well-deï¬ned hol ographic dual. By well-deï¬ned
 we mean generally covariant. Hence, our strategy for examin ing the entanglement entropy
 dual in a general time-dependent scenario will be to ï¬rst ï¬nd a suitable fully covariant
 generalization of the minimal-surface proposal, and then t o use this â€˜covariant holographic
 entanglement entropyâ€™ deï¬nition3to ï¬nd the time-variation in the speciï¬c cases of interest.
 To motivate the possibility of generalizing the dual of enta nglement entropy in time-
 dependent scenarios, it is useful to think of the analogy wit h a spacelike geodesic (which
 in fact describes the minimal surface for a 3-dimensional bu lk). In Euclidean spacetimes,
 spacelike geodesics are local minima of the proper length fu nctional. However, in Lorentzian
 spacetimes they are extrema of the proper length. Likewise, we expect that the natural
 analog of the Euclidean minimal surface to be an extremal surface , denoted by Wbelow,
 which is a saddle point of the proper area functional. This ex pectation is indeed realized,
 and forms the primary result of this paper.
 For stationary bulk geometries with a timelike Killing ï¬eld , the entanglement entropy is
 likewise time independent, and there exists a canonical fol iation of the bulk spacetime Mby
 spacelike surfaces. In a generic time-dependent backgroun d there is no preferred canonical
 foliation in the bulk. In contrast, for a QFT on a ï¬xed backgro und we do have a natural
 notion of time. The issue from a gravitational standpoint is then whether a given spacelike
 foliation in âˆ‚M=/producttext
 tâˆ‚NtÃ—Rt, extends in a unique fashion into the bulk to provide us
 with the requisite foliation of M. If the answer is in the aï¬ƒrmative, then we can use the
 spacelike slices thus constructed and ï¬nd minimal surfaces localized within them.
 Indeed, even in time-dependent geometries it is plausible t hat there is a natural slicing
 of the bulk spacetime M: we can deï¬ne â€œmaximal areaâ€ co-dimension one spacelike sli ces
 Î£, by the vanishing trace of the extrinsic curvature on Î£. Sin ce each Î£ is spacelike, we
 3In what follows, to simplify the terminology somewhat, we wi ll sometimes denote this as simply â€œco-
 variant entanglement entropyâ€; it should be clear from cont ext when we mean the gravitational dual and
 when we are talking about the QFT quantity.
 6now have a well-deï¬ned prescription for ï¬nding a minimal-ar ea (bulk co-dimension two)
 surface localized within Î£ and anchored at âˆ‚A. We denote this â€˜minimal surface on maximal
 sliceâ€™ by X. The surface Xis covariantly deï¬ned, and like Wit reduces correctly to the
 requisite minimal surface for static spacetimes, thereby p roviding another candidate for the
 covariant entanglement entropy. However, as we will see, to make contact with a holographic
 perspective we will have to elevate the notion of the maximal slice to that of a totally geodesic
 co-dimension one slice.
 In this paper we examine the two constructions WandXmotivated above, and propose
 a more appealing covariant generalization Yof the geometric construction of [ 24,10] to
 compute entanglement entropy in general asymptotically Ad S spacetimes. The basic idea
 behind our proposal is to exploit the light-sheet construct ion of the covariant entropy bounds
 of Bousso [ 35,36,37]. Light-sheets are a natural concept in Lorentzian spaceti mes and serve
 to single out a co-dimension two spacelike surface of the bul k manifold whose area bounds the
 entropy passing through its light-sheet in the context of th e covariant entropy bounds. We
 will denote this surface, whose construction we focus on in w hat follows, by Y. The minimal
 surface Xconstruction also singles out a co-dimension two spacelike surface, albeit by ï¬rst
 picking a spacelike foliation and then ï¬nding a co-dimensio n one surface within the leaves of
 the foliation. It is thus natural to expect that there is an in timate relation between the light-
 sheet construction and minimal surfaces and indeed we will s how that they are equivalent if
 a given time slice is totally geodesic. We hope a similar argu ment can be applied to more
 general spacetimes with boundaries allowing bulk non-triv ial minimal surfaces.
 A natural way to motivate the light-sheet construction is to consider a cut-oï¬€ ï¬eld theory
 in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. The dual description of t he bulk is then in terms of a cut-
 oï¬€ ï¬eld theory coupled to dynamical gravity on the cut-oï¬€ sur face. Due to the gravitational
 dynamics in the boundary ï¬eld theory the entropy associated with any co-dimension two
 surface bounds the amount of information that passes throug h the light-sheet associated
 with that surface. The spacelike co-dimension two surface c an be taken to be the boundary
 âˆ‚Aof the subsystem A. Aided by this construction we can extend the light-sheets t hat live
 on the cut-oï¬€ surface into bulk light-sheets and ask what is t he spacelike surface in the bulk
 associated with these? Imposing the constraint that the spa celike co-dimension two4surface
 inMbe required to have boundary âˆ‚Aonâˆ‚Mso that light-sheets can end on it, we can
 ï¬nd the bulk surface we were looking for.
 While this motivates the proposal for a covariantization of the geometric prescription
 for ï¬nding the entanglement entropy in terms of light-sheet s in this formulation, it is not
 very constructive. There is in fact a simple algorithm for ac tually constructing the bulk
 surface Yin question: ï¬nd the spacelike co-dimension two surface who se boundary coincides
 4Note that co-dimension two surface in the cut-oï¬€ boundary co rresponds to a co-dimension three surface
 in the full bulk; so here the requisite surface has the same di mension as Arather than âˆ‚Aâ€“ see Table 1in
 Appendix A.
 7withâˆ‚Aonâˆ‚Mwith the constraint that the trace of the null extrinsic curv atures ( i.e.the
 null expansions) associated with the two null normals to Yvanish. For smooth surfaces
 parameterized by two functions this leads in general to some partial diï¬€erential equations
 which can be solved to obtain a precise construction of the su rface. Furthermore, we can
 show that this deï¬nition of Yis actually equivalent to the requirement that Yis the co-
 dimension two extremal surface in the Lorentzian manifold w ith the speciï¬ed boundary
 condition. In other words, Y=W. Thus this construction naturally reduces to the minimal
 surface prescription of [ 24,10].
 As a check in a simple non-static example, we analytically co mpute the holographic en-
 tanglement entropy of three dimensional rotating (BTZ) bla ck holes employing our covariant
 prescription. The result precisely agrees with the entropy calculated in the dual two dimen-
 sional CFT. Furthermore, we also argue that the prescriptio n of ï¬nding the surface Yusing
 the vanishing null extrinsic curvatures can be derived from a bulk-boundary relation a la.,
 GKP-W relation [ 38,39] for the AdS/CFT correspondence. One can set up a variationa l
 problem by exploiting these ideas and show that the action pr inciple in gravity singles out
 the extremal surface.
 Once we have a covariant prescription for computing the Lore ntzian extremal surface
 inMwe can ask the basic questions that motivated the investigat ion in the ï¬rst place,
 such as whether the entanglement entropy has deï¬nite monoto nicity properties vis a vis
 temporal evolution. To address this issue we discuss the exa mple of a spacetime background
 involving a collapse scenario leading to black hole formati on; the spacetime is modeled by
 a Vaidya-AdS spacetime. Due to the formation of a black hole i n the bulk, we expect that
 the dual ï¬eld theory on the boundary thermalizes. The therma lization is expected to lead
 to an increase in the entanglement entropy: the ergodic mixi ng of the boundary degrees of
 freedom would suggest that the degrees of freedom localized in region Ainteract more with
 those in Band thereby one expects that the entanglement entropy grows in time. The bulk
 computation using the light-sheet prescription bears out t his picture nicely.
 Another example where a covariant formulation is necessary is the case of wormhole
 spacetimes in AdS with two disconnected boundaries [ 40]. Even though the two CFTs on
 the two disconnected boundaries look decoupled from each ot her, there are non-vanishing
 correlation functions between two theories in the dual grav ity calculation as pointed out
 in [40]. We would like to present a possible resolution to this puzz le by computing the
 entanglement entropy between the two CFTs.
 The outline of the paper is as follows: we begin in Â§2with a quick review of the minimal
 surface proposal for static spacetimes and the reasons to ex pect a covariant generalization
 of this picture. We then proceed in Â§3to motivate the light-sheet construction for time-
 dependent backgrounds. We present a manifestly covariant h olographic entanglement en-
 tropy in this section, which is the most important conclusio n of this paper. We explain how
 this construction can be naturally motivated from a variati onal principle and its connection
 8to the bulk-boundary relation within the AdS/CFT context in Â§4. InÂ§5we illustrate the
 calculations of the entanglement entropy using our covaria nt proposal and demonstrate the
 consistent agreement with the minimal surface prescriptio n of [ 24,10]. We also examine
 rotating BTZ black holes, which are stationary but non-stat ic, and show that our covariant
 proposal precisely reproduces the entanglement entropy co mputed from the CFT side. In Â§6
 we discuss the explicit time-dependent situation of gravit ational collapse and argue that the
 entanglement entropy increases monotonically in this cont ext. We discuss other interesting
 time-dependent backgrounds, such as AdS wormholes and bubb les of nothing in Â§7and end
 with a discussion in Â§8. In Appendix Awe present a simpler covariant construction which
 whilst not reproducing the correct minimal surface in gener al is nevertheless interesting in
 that it provides a bound on the entanglement entropy. In Appe ndixBwe give a proof of
 equivalence between the vanishing of null expansions and th e extremal surface. In Appendix
 Cwe presents some details of the calculations of the time-dep endent entanglement entropy
 in the Vaidya-AdS background using perturbative methods.
 2 Entanglement entropy and time-dependent QFTs
 As mentioned in the Introduction, our main aim is to ï¬nd a cova riant prescription for calcu-
 lating the entanglement entropy associated with a given reg ion of the boundary conformal
 ï¬eld theory. We begin by reviewing the minimal surface propo sal of [ 24,10], which pro-
 vides the ï¬rst step of geometrization of entanglement entro py in the AdS/CFT context, and
 which will serve to set up the background and notation for the subsequent generalization
 to non-stationary spacetimes. We then argue that entanglem ent entropy remains a well-
 deï¬ned concept in time-varying states in the ï¬eld theory, an d motivate a correspondingly
 well-deï¬ned dual geometric construction which would accom modate any time-dependence in
 the bulk. Finally, we remark that there are in fact many such p lausible constructions, and
 give an overview of those we focus on in the present paper.
 2.1 Review of holographic entanglement entropy
 Consider a d+ 1 dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetime Mwith conformal boundary
 âˆ‚M. For the present we will concentrate on the static case when Madmits a timelike
 Killing ï¬eld/parenleftbigâˆ‚
 âˆ‚t/parenrightbigÂµ. On the boundary âˆ‚MofM, which serves as the background for the
 dual ï¬eld theory, time translations are generated by/parenleftbigâˆ‚
 âˆ‚t/parenrightbigÂµwhich is simply the pullback of
 the bulk Killing ï¬eld. Thus we can naturally foliate the boun daryâˆ‚Mby spacelike surfaces
 which are normal to this timelike Killing ï¬eld so that âˆ‚M=/producttext
 tâˆ‚NtÃ—Rt. Consider then a
 particular leaf âˆ‚Nof this foliation which we wish to divide into into two region sAandBso
 thatâˆ‚N=A âˆª B . The boundary between these regions is denoted as âˆ‚A(=âˆ‚B) assuming
 thatâˆ‚Nis a compact manifold. Note that Ais (dâˆ’1)-dimensional and âˆ‚Ais therefore
 9(dâˆ’2)-dimensional.
 For a QFT on âˆ‚Mwe can calculate the entanglement entropy associated with t he region
 A. Since there are inï¬nitely many degrees of freedom in an ordi nary QFT, it is known that
 the entanglement entropy suï¬€ers from an ultraviolet diverg ence. The standard result is that
 the leading divergence of entanglement entropy scales as th e area of the boundary âˆ‚Abetween
 the two regions (or sub-systems, as they are conventionally referred to in the entanglement
 entropy literature) [ 22,23]. The intuitive reason of this area law for the divergent par t is
 that the most entangled degrees of freedom are the high energ y ones localized within an
 inï¬nitesimal neighbourhood of âˆ‚A. Essentially,
 SA=Î±Area(âˆ‚A)
 Îµdâˆ’1+Â·Â·Â·, (2.1)
 where we have indicated the leading divergent behaviour ( Î±is a constant factor). The
 inï¬nitesimally small parameter Ç«denotes the ultraviolet divergence ( i.e.lattice spacing).
 The subleading terms contain slower power law or logarithmi c divergences apart from ï¬nite
 terms which are of interest.
 Since we work within the AdS/CFT context we can ask whether th e entanglement entropy
 for the boundary QFT can be calculated using a purely geometr ic construction in the bulk;
 this question was answered in the aï¬ƒrmative in [ 24,10]. The essential idea behind the
 picture of [ 24,10] is the following: by virtue of time translation invariance , the boundary
 spacelike foliation naturally extends into the bulk to prov ide a canonical spacelike foliation/producttext
 tNtofM. On a given spacelike slice in the Mwe are instructed to construct a minimal
 (area) surface which ends on âˆ‚A âŠ‚âˆ‚N. This is a well deï¬ned problem and the minimal
 surface which is a spacelike surface of vanishing mean curva ture is guaranteed to exist due
 to the Euclidean signature of the bulk spacelike slice. Thus , given the minimal surface Smin,

 Note that the minimal surface Sis a co-dimension two surface in the bulk spacetime Mby
 virtue of being a co-dimension one submanifold of a particul ar leaf of the spacelike foliation.
 2.2 Entanglement entropy in time-dependent states in QFT
 For states in QFT with trivial time-dependence, one can calc ulate the entanglement entropy
 in a conventional manner by looking at the decomposition of t he total Hilbert space on a
 given time-slice. The holographic perspective of this is ca ptured by the minimal surface pre-
 scription indicated in ( 2.2). It is clear from the outset that in QFT nothing prevents us f rom
 considering explicitly time-varying states and computing entanglement entropy for subsys-
 tems thereof. It is easy to give a path-integral prescriptio n for computing the entanglement
 entropy in these circumstances and we outline the basic meth odology below.
 10Consider a quantum ï¬eld theory in a time-dependent backgrou nd. Its evolution in time
 is described by the time-dependent Hamiltonian H(t). A state at the time t=t1is deï¬ned
 by|Î¨(t1)âˆa\}bâˆ‡acketâˆ‡i}ht. It is related to the state at the time t0via the familiar formula
 |Î¨(t1)âˆa\}bâˆ‡acketâˆ‡i}ht=Texp/parenleftbigg
 âˆ’i/integraldisplayt1
 t0dt H(t)/parenrightbigg
 |Î¨(t0)âˆa\}bâˆ‡acketâˆ‡i}ht. (2.3)
 In the path integral formulation, the ket state |Î¨(t1)âˆa\}bâˆ‡acketâˆ‡i}htis equivalently constructed by the
 path-integral5fromt=âˆ’âˆžtot=t1
 Î¨ (t1, Ï†0(x)) =/integraldisplayt=t1
 t=âˆ’âˆž[DÏ†]eiS(Ï†)Î´(Ï†(t1, x)âˆ’Ï†0(x)), (2.4)
 where we represent all ï¬elds by Ï†. On the other hand, the bra state âˆa\}bâˆ‡acketle{tÎ¨(t1)|is expressed as
 follows:
 Î¨(t1, Ï†0(x)) =/integraldisplayt=âˆž
 t=t1[DÏ†]eiS(Ï†)Î´(Ï†(t1, x)âˆ’Ï†0(x)). (2.5)
 Clearly they satisfy
 iâˆ‚
 âˆ‚t|Î¨(t)âˆa\}bâˆ‡acketâˆ‡i}ht=H(t)|Î¨(t)âˆa\}bâˆ‡acketâˆ‡i}ht, iâˆ‚
 âˆ‚tâˆa\}bâˆ‡acketle{tÎ¨(t)|=âˆ’âˆa\}bâˆ‡acketle{tÎ¨(t)|H(t). (2.6)
 Let us ï¬rst assume the total system is described by a pure stat e|Î¨(t)âˆa\}bâˆ‡acketâˆ‡i}htwith unit norm
 at vanishing temperature. Then the total density matrix is g iven by
 Ïtot(t) =|Î¨(t)âˆa\}bâˆ‡acketâˆ‡i}htâˆa\}bâˆ‡acketle{tÎ¨(t)|, (2.7)
 and its time-evolution is dictated by the von-Neumann equat ion
 iâˆ‚Ïtot(t)
 âˆ‚t= [H(t), Ïtot(t)]. (2.8)
 In the gravitational context we will consider interesting e xamples with event horizons. These
 will be described in the dual CFT by a mixed state and so we need to formulate the theory
 by using only the density matrix Ïtot(t). However, even in such cases we expect to have
 an equivalent description in terms of a pure state by assumin g another CFT sector hidden
 inside the horizons as in the Schwarzschild-AdS case [ 21], or other degrees of freedom in
 more general circumstances as in the examples of [ 41]. Thus the assumption ( 2.7) does not
 exclude the choice of density matrices, so long as we can puri fy the state by passage to a
 enlarged Hilbert space (which, in the geometry, correspond s to another sector behind the
 horizon).
 Divide the total Hilbert space into a direct product of two Hi lbert spaces at time t:
 Htot=HAâŠ— HB. In the quantum ï¬eld theory, this is realized by dividing the total space

 ground state.
 11manifold âˆ‚Nat a ï¬xed time into two parts AandB. Then the entanglement entropy SA(t)
 at time tis deï¬ned as follows
 SA(t) =âˆ’TrA(ÏA(t) logÏA(t)), (2.9)
 where ÏA(t) is the reduced density matrix
 ÏA(t) = Tr BÏtot(t) = Tr B|Î¨(t)âˆa\}bâˆ‡acketâˆ‡i}htâˆa\}bâˆ‡acketle{tÎ¨(t)|. (2.10)
 We always normalize any (reduced) density matrices Ïsuch that their trace is one i.e.,
 TrÏ= 1. In order to express SA(t) in the path integral formalism, we need to ï¬rst describe
 the reduced density matrix in that formalism (see also [ 5,34,42,10]). Taking the trace in
 the Hilbert space HBin (2.10) is equivalent to partially gluing two boundaries in ( 2.4) and
 (2.5) along B. Thus it is described by the path-integral over the whole spa cetime with an
 inï¬nitesimally small slit along Aat a ï¬xed time t

 Given the deï¬nition of the trace of the density matrix ÏAin (2.11), it is easy to calculate
 the trace Tr( ÏA)n. This is calculated by integrating the products of path-int egrals
 [ÏA(t)]Ï†1+Ï†1âˆ’[ÏA(t)]Ï†2+Ï†2âˆ’Â·Â·Â·[ÏA(t)]Ï†n+Ï†nâˆ’, (2.13)
 successively with the identiï¬cations: Ï†1âˆ’=Ï†2+,Ï†2âˆ’=Ï†3+,Â·Â·Â·andÏ†nâˆ’=Ï†1+. In other
 words, this is essentially the partition function Zn(t) on the (singular) manifold âˆ‚Mnwhich
 is deï¬ned by the ncopies of the total manifold Mglued along Aat the ï¬xed time t
 Tr (ÏA(t))n=Zn(t)
 (Z1)n. (2.14)
 Knowledge of the partition function Zn(t) on the singular manifold, then allows us to compute
 the entanglement entropy using:

 2.3 Towards holographic entanglement entropy in time-depe ndent states
 The discussion of entanglement entropy in time-dependent Q FT states in the previous section
 makes it clear that there is no a priori obstruction in thinking about this issue from a ï¬eld
 12theoretic perspective. In the AdS/CFT context we would then like to ask whether the
 holographic entanglement entropy proposal of [ 24,10] can be generalized to time-dependent
 scenarios. In particular, can we ï¬nd a suitable generalizat ion of the minimal surface which
 is fully covariant? The answer is of course yes, and in fact we will propose several covariant
 constructions in this and the next section, and examine the r elations between them.
 To motivate the existence of a suitable covariantly well-de ï¬ned surface, we start6by
 indicating the construction of the surface which we will den ote as X, which is the most naive
 generalization of the minimal surface in the case of static b ulk spacetimes. Consider a time-
 dependent version of the AdS/CFT correspondence where the b oundary theory is taken to
 be in a time-varying state on a ï¬xed background âˆ‚M. The corresponding bulk geometry M
 will have an explicit time-dependence and hence no timelike Killing ï¬eld. Since the metric
 onâˆ‚Mis non-dynamical in the boundary, we can choose a foliation b y equal time slices,
 by picking our time coordinate such that it implements the na tural Hamiltonian evolution
 of the ï¬eld theory, so that âˆ‚M=âˆ‚NtÃ—Rt. We can choose to consider a region Atâˆˆâˆ‚Nt
 on a given time slice as in Â§2.2and compute the entanglement entropy using the path
 integral prescription. The question then is what is the anal og of this computation from a
 bulk perspective?
 Naively, one would expect that the minimal surface prescrip tion for computing the holo-
 graphic entanglement entropy should go through. However, t his cannot quite be the case;
 as mentioned in Â§1, in Lorentzian spacetimes one has to be careful about deï¬nin g suitable
 minimal area surfaces due to the indeï¬nite metric signature .
 The crucial issue in a Lorentzian setting is the fact that gen erically, the equal-time
 foliation on the boundary âˆ‚Mdoes not necessarily lead to a canonical ( i.e., symmetry-
 motivated) foliation of the bulk M. Supposing for the moment that a natural foliation was
 singled out; we could then compute the holographic entangle ment entropy by ï¬rst picking the
 preferred spacelike slice NtofMgiven by extending the slice from âˆ‚M. OnNtthe induced
 metric is spacelike and the notion of the minimal surface is w ell deï¬ned. The holographic
 prescription then amounts to ï¬nding a minimal surface S âˆˆ N such that âˆ‚S|âˆ‚M=âˆ‚A.
 The above observation suggests that we look for a covariantl y deï¬ned spacelike slice
 of the bulk, Nt, anchored at âˆ‚Nt, which reduces to the constant- tslice for static bulk.
 Generically, while one expects no preferred/natural time s licing of M, it is plausible that
 for asymptotically AdS spacetimes one has a preferred folia tion by zero7mean curvature
 slicesi.e., slices with vanishing trace of extrinsic curvature. Physi cally, each of these slices
 corresponds to the maximal area spacelike slice through the bulk, anchored at the boundary
 6Those readers who would like to know the ï¬nal conclusion imme diately are advised to skip to the
 covariant entanglement entropy proposal (I) and (II) in Â§3.1andÂ§3.3.
 7In general, any constant mean curvature slice of the bulk pro vides a covariantly well-deï¬ned surface;
 however, when this constant is non-zero it doesnâ€™t satisfy t he requirement of reducing to the constant- tslice
 in static bulk.
 13sliceâˆ‚N.8We denote the leaves of this maximal-area foliation by Î£ t.
 One might worry that the maximal-area slice is not well deï¬ne d because an area of a
 given surface can always be increased by â€œcrumplingâ€ or wigg ling the surface in the spatial
 directions; however, here the crucial point is that our slic e has co-dimension one, extending
 over all the available spatial directions, and therefore al lows no room for wiggling. An-
 other possible concern is the fact that in asymptotically Ad S spacetimes, the area of any
 spacelike slice is manifestly inï¬nite. However, this is the familiar problem of regulating
 the lengths/areas/volumes in AdS, which we know how to deal w ith. Below, we will use a
 simple background subtraction technique, and regulate all quantities by subtracting oï¬€ the
 corresponding values in pure AdS.
 Provided we have this special, maximal spacelike slice Î£ tthrough the bulk, we proceed as
 outlined above: on this slice, we construct the minimal-are a surface anchored at âˆ‚At. This
 amounts to a mini-max algorithm for the holographic entangl ement entropy; ï¬nd a maximal
 slice in the bulk which agrees with the spacelike foliation o fâˆ‚Mand in that maximal slice
 ï¬nd a minimal surface X. In this setup, one may obtain a natural proposal that the are a of
 Xthen gives the entanglement entropy,
 SA=Area(X)
 4G(d+1)
 N. (2.16)
 Note that the surface Xby construction satisï¬es the three basic pre-requisites fo r being a
 candidate dual of the entanglement entropy of A: it is covariantly well-deï¬ned, it is anchored
 atâˆ‚A, and it reduces to the requisite minimal surface when the bul k spacetime is static.
 However, we will argue that this prescription doesnâ€™t follo w naturally from a holographic
 viewpoint and needs to be ï¬nessed slightly to make contact wi th the holographic perspective.
 Thus, rather than stopping at our candidate surface X, in the next section we will propose
 another candidate surface, Y, as a more natural dual of the entanglement entropy. In fact,
 this holographic formulation will provide a more straightf orward algorithmic construction of
 the requisite surface Y. Our starting point is motivated by the idea of light-sheets introduced
 in the context of covariant entropy bounds in gravitational theories. We will argue that the
 prescription which we ï¬nd in terms of light-sheets reduces t o the intuitive picture presented
 above, modulo some subtleties, with the added bonus of provi ding an explicit equation for
 the extremal surface.
 2.4 Preview of covariant constructions
 Before delving into the details of these constructions, we b rieï¬‚y list them with a short
 summary of our ï¬nal conclusion, to orient the reader and ï¬x th e notation. In all cases, the
 8We thank Doug Eardley, Gary Horowitz, and Don Marolf for disc ussions on this issue.
 14requisite surface is a co-dimension two bulk surface which i s anchored on the boundary at
 âˆ‚At. In addition, all of these constructions are fully covarian t â€“ they do not depend on
 any particular choice of coordinates â€“ and therefore are phy sically well-deï¬ned. Also, these
 surfaces are mutually closely related; although diï¬€erent s ymbols are used to indicate diï¬€erent
 constructions, this is not meant to imply that the surfaces t hus constructed are necessarily
 distinct. In part of what follows we will examine the speciï¬c relations between them.
 â€¢ W: extremal surface, given by a saddle point of the area action . In 3-dimensional bulk,
 this is simply the spacelike geodesic through the bulk conne cting the points âˆ‚At. We
 return to discuss this surface in Â§4.1.
 â€¢ X: minimal-area surface on maximal-area (co-dimension one) slice of the bulk. The
 construction was motivated in Â§2.3and we will discuss some subtleties and generaliza-
 tions in Â§4.2. In particular, we will show that Xcoincides with the extremal surface
 WifXis situated on a totally geodesic spacelike surface.
 â€¢ Y: surface wherefrom the null expansions along the requisite future and past light-
 sheets vanish. This will be the construction we primarily fo cus on. In fact, we propose
 two constructions, Ymin
 AtinÂ§3.1, and YextinÂ§3.3. We will later see that Ymin
 Atand
 Yextare equivalent to the extremal surface W(we present a proof in the Appendix B).
 â€¢ Z: â€˜causal construction,â€™ discussed mainly in Appendix A: minimal-area surface on
 the boundary of the causal wedge of the boundary domain of dep endence of At.
 Our main claim of this paper will be that the covariant hologr aphic entanglement entropy
 is obtained from the area of the surface W=Y. In a generic time-dependent spacetime,
 we will ï¬nd that another surface Xdeviates slightly from W=Y. We will also conï¬rm
 thatW,X, andYall reduce to the minimal surface in static bulk spacetime; h owever this
 is not necessarily the case for Z. Nevertheless, Zwill be useful because, as we motivate
 in Appendix A, it provides a bound on the entanglement entropy, and is comp utationally
 simpler to ï¬nd.
 3 Covariant holographic entanglement entropy and light-sh eets
 3.1 Light-sheets and covariant constructions
 To motivate the natural covariant generalization of a holog raphic entanglement entropy
 proposal, it is useful to recall the construction of covaria nt entropy bounds in gravitational
 theories. The main issue in deï¬ning covariant entropy bound s was to put a bound on
 the entropy/information passing through a given region of s pacetime in a fashion that is
 independent of the choice of coordinates or slicing. A clear formulation of covariant entropy
 15bounds was achieved by Bousso [ 35,36,37] using the concept of light-sheets. A discussion
 of this entropy bound applied to the AdS/CFT, which stimulat es our arguments below, can
 be found in [ 43].

 Light-Sheet LS
 Fig. 1: A light-sheet LSfor a co-dimension two space-like surface S. The null geodesics on the
 light-sheet are converging, i.e., the expansion is non-positive.
 Before proceeding to discuss the relevance of light-sheets for calculating entanglement
 entropy, let us review the concept of a light-sheet. Given an y co-dimension two spacelike
 surface Sin a spacetime manifold M, we construct four congruences of future/past null
 geodesics from the surface in in-going and out-going direct ions. A light-sheet LSforS
 corresponds to those null geodesic congruences for which th e expansion of the null geodesics
 is non-positive deï¬nite (we will explain the deï¬nition of th e expansion of null geodesics in
 the next subsection; physically, we require that the cross s ectional area at a constant aï¬ƒne
 parameter along the congruence does not increase). The null geodesics along the light-sheet
 are converging and will eventually develop caustics; at any such point the light-sheet gets
 cut oï¬€. According to the covariant entropy bound (Bousso bou nd), the entropy or amount
 of information SLSthat can pass through a light-sheet ( i.e.the integral of the entropy ï¬‚ux
 on the light-sheet [ 44]) is bounded by the area of spacelike surface as follows:
 SLSâ‰¤Area(S)
 4GN. (3.1)
 We would like to propose that the correct generalization of t he holographic entanglement
 entropy is in terms of these light-sheets. One can motivate t his claim by analyzing the QFT
 coupled to gravity as in a brane-world set-up ( i.e., RS II model [ 45]). Indeed, the Bekenstein-
 Hawking entropy of brane-world black holes can be interpret ed as an entanglement entropy
 in this setup, as discussed in [ 28,20].
 Consider the setup of the AdS d+1/CFT dwith an explicit UV cut-oï¬€ in the bulk, z > Îµ,
 where zis the AdS radial coordinate, chosen such that the boundary i s atz= 0. We choose
 16PoincarÂ´ e coordinates for AdS d+1(with the radius of AdS set to unity for simplicity)

 The UV cut-oï¬€ Îµis inï¬nitesimally small and is interpreted as a lattice spac ing. This setup is
 equivalent to the one of the brane-world where a very weak gra vity exists on the ddimensional
 brane located on the cut-oï¬€ surface. The Newtonâ€™s constant f or the brane will be taken to
 beG(d)
 N. By the AdS/CFT correspondence this set-up is dual to the bul kd+ 1 dimensional
 AdS spacetime with the cut-oï¬€ and a bulk Newtonâ€™s constant G(d+1)

 Since the brane-world theory has gravity coupled to the QFT, we can consider the Bousso
 bound for the ddimensional boundary theory. We then would like to translat e the compu-
 tation of this bound holographically into a calculation fro m the viewpoint of the bulk d+ 1
 dimensional gravity. In the boundary the calculation would proceed by ï¬nding the light-
 sheets associated with the particular region Awe want to focus on. Since in the boundary
 ï¬eld theory the light-sheets bound the region which is relev ant for any entropy bound, the
 corresponding bulk prescription should likewise include n o more than this region. A natu-
 ral expectation is then that the co-dimension two surface in the boundary has a canonical
 extension into the bulk spacetime in such a way that the assoc iated bulk light-sheets are
 anchored on the boundary light-sheets under the appropriat e restriction. Of course, there are
 potentially many surfaces that satisfy this requirement; w e will then pick the one that gives
 the strongest bound on the bulk entropy. Our claim then amoun ts to the statement that the
 dual bulk entropy bounds can be found by extending the bounda ry light-sheet (which was
 employed to ï¬nd the covariant entropy bound in the boundary t heory) into the bulk.
 One intriguing consequence of this proposal is that the bulk results include quantum
 corrections, while the boundary results do not, as is famili ar in AdS/CFT. Let us see how
 these quantum corrections look like in a speciï¬c example. We are interested in the Bousso
 bound for the spacelike surface Sdâˆ’2,i.e.adâˆ’2 dimensional sphere with the radius lin
 theddimensional brane-world. We choose Aa submanifold on a time-slice t=t0such that
 âˆ‚A=Sdâˆ’2. At the classical level, we obtain the entropy bound
 SAâ‰¤Area(âˆ‚A)
 4G(d)
 N. (3.4)
 In order to take into account the quantum corrections, we ext end the light-sheet from âˆ‚A=
 Sdâˆ’2to that from half of a dâˆ’1 dimensional sphere SAin the bulk AdS. Then we obtain
 the quantum corrected entropy bound

 17The ï¬nite diï¬€erence between the above quantum and classical entropy bound is analogous
 to the Casimir energy.
 An alternate way to explain our motivation for considering l ight-sheets is to think of the
 entanglement entropy as being directly related to the (ther modynamic) entropy computed
 by the Bousso bound. More precisely, we would like to claim th atthe entanglement entropy
 saturates the Bousso bound in the setup of the AdS/CFT correspondence or the related
 brane-world version. While the claim that entanglement ent ropy is related to light-sheets
 isa priori very surprising, the example of the static AdS background st rongly suggests
 this interpretation (see also [ 25]). Similarly, the bulk-boundary relation (so called GKP-W
 relation [ 38,39]) in the AdS/CFT correspondence leads to the same conclusio n. A weaker
 version of this claim will be that the entanglement entropy satisï¬es the Bousso bound . What
 we have argued in the above is summarized as the following pro posal for direct holographic
 computation of entanglement entropy.
 A Covariant Entanglement Entropy Proposal (I): Consider the usual AdS/CFT
 setup in a d+1 dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetime Mwithddimensional boundary
 âˆ‚M. We will choose the boundary âˆ‚Mto be either R1,dâˆ’1orRÃ—Sdâˆ’1; in the following
 we usually assume PoincarÂ´ e coordinates for simplicity. As explained earlier, at time t, we
 divide the dâˆ’1 dimensional space of the boundary theory into AtandBt. The boundary
 âˆ‚Atbetween these domains will play an important role. Note that âˆ‚Atis adâˆ’2 dimensional
 spacelike surface in âˆ‚M.
 Now, we can construct the upper and lower light-sheets âˆ‚L+
 tandâˆ‚Lâˆ’
 tfor the spacelike
 surface âˆ‚At. This can be done in a straightforward manner using the confo rmally ï¬‚at metric
 onâˆ‚M. We then consider extensions LÂ±
 tof the two light-sheets âˆ‚LÂ±
 tinto bulk such that they
 are the light-sheets in Mwith respect to a dâˆ’1 dimensional spacelike surface Yt=L+
 tâˆ©Lâˆ’

 as in the left ï¬gure of Fig. 2.
 Given this, we propose that the (possibly time-dependent) e ntanglement entropy for the
 subsystem Atin the dual boundary theory is given by
 SAt(t) =minY(Area( Yt))
 4G(d+1)
 N. (3.6)
 Here min Y(Area( Yt)) denotes the minimum of the area over the set of Yas we vary the form

 3.2 Expansions of null geodesics
 As we have already seen, the deï¬nition of the light-sheet inv olves the expansions of null
 geodesics. Since this quantity plays a crucial role in the di scussions below, we will pause to
 explain its deï¬nition and properties (for details refer to e.g., [46,43,47]).
 Given a co-dimension two surface Sin a spacetime manifold speciï¬ed by two constraints
 Ï•1(xÎ½) = 0 , Ï• 2(xÎ½) = 0 , (3.8)
 we can deï¬ne two one-forms âˆ‡Î½Ï•i,i= 1,2. Non-degeneracy requires that there be two
 linearly independent one-forms and so âˆ‡Î½Ï•1+Âµâˆ‡Î½Ï•2has to be a null one-form for two
 distinct values of Âµ. Using this information one can construct two null-vectors NÂµ
 Â±that are
 orthogonal to the surface of interest:
 NÂµ
 Â±=gÂµÎ½(âˆ‡Î½Ï•1+ÂµÂ±âˆ‡Î½Ï•2). (3.9)
 We can ï¬x the null vectors to be normalized such that
 NÂµ
 +NÎ½
 âˆ’gÂµÎ½=âˆ’1. (3.10)
 In terms of NÂµ
 Â±and the induced metric hÂµÎ½on the surface Swe can write down the null
 extrinsic curvatures:
 (Ï‡Â±)ÂµÎ½=hÏ
 ÂµhÎ»
 Î½âˆ‡Ï(NÂ±)Î». (3.11)
 The expansion of an orthogonal null geodesic congruence to t he surface is then given by
 the trace of the null extrinsic curvature9
 Î¸Â±= (Ï‡Â±)Âµ
 Âµ. (3.12)
 9Because we are interested in null geodesic congruences, the re is no natural scale associated with the
 19Physically, the null expansions measure the rate of change o f the area of the co-dimension
 two surface Spropagated along the null vectors. Let us express the embedd ing map from S
 to the spacetime MbyXÂµ(Î¾Î±), where Î¾Î±denote the coordinates on S. Under an inï¬nitesimal
 deformation Î´XÂµ(Î¾Î±) orthogonal to Swith ï¬xed boundary conditions, the change in the area
 ofSis obtained from the value of the expansions (see e.g.[48]):
 Î´Areaâˆ/integraldisplay
 S(Î¸+NÂµ
 +Î´XÂµ+Î¸âˆ’NÂµ
 âˆ’Î´XÂµ), (3.13)
 where the proportionality constant is positive. Therefore determining the sign of the null
 expansions Î¸Â±is equivalent to ï¬nding whether the area increases or decrea ses when we
 perform an inï¬nitesimal deformation. In addition, ( 3.13) clearly shows that the surfaces
 Swith vanishing null expansions are extremal surfaces W,i.e., saddle points of the area
 functional. An explicit proof of this is given in Appendix B.
 3.3 The covariant entanglement entropy prescription and ex tremal surface
 InÂ§3.1we presented a covariant proposal for calculating the holog raphic entanglement
 entropy based on a light-sheet construction. Although mani festly covariant, the computation
 of the surface YAstill involves ï¬rst constructing all possible light-sheet s in the bulk LÂ±
 subject to the appropriate boundary condition and then mini mizing the area of the spacelike
 co-dimension two slice Y=L+âˆ©Lâˆ’over all the possibilities. We now argue that this
 procedure can be vastly streamlined to produce a simple set o f partial diï¬€erential equations
 for the surface. Furthermore, in Â§4.1we will show that the resulting prescription follows
 naturally from a bulkâ€“boundary relation a la., GKP-W [ 38,39] in the AdS/CFT context.
 The covariant construction of Â§3.1starts from the two boundary light-sheets, âˆ‚L+
 t(fu-
 ture) and âˆ‚Lâˆ’
 t(past), which are uniquely deï¬ned given a subsystem Atin the dual CFT
 onâˆ‚Mat time t. We then pick a co-dimension two spacelike surface YAtinMwhose
 boundaries coincide with âˆ‚Atas in Fig. 2. There are many such surfaces, but we are only
 interested in the ones which we can sandwich between the two l ight-sheets L+(future) and
 Lâˆ’(past) in the bulk spacetime. The existence of such light-sh eets leads to the constraints
 for the expansions,
 Î¸Ë†+â‰¤0, Î¸ Ë†âˆ’â‰¤0, (3.14)
 where Î¸Ë†+refers to the expansion along the null congruence generatin gL+and similarly Î¸Ë†âˆ’
 forLâˆ’. The expansions Î¸Ë†Â±are equal to Î¸Â±deï¬ned in Â§3.2up to a sign. Along a single
 aï¬ƒne parameter along the congruence. We can choose to normal ize the null vectors by scaling NÂ±â†’Î³Â±NÂ±
 (Î³Â±are functions on S), whilst keeping them tangent to the null geodesics. In prac tice, we usually omit
 the scaling, since we are typically interested only in the si gn of the expansions, and these scale simply as
 Î¸Â±â†’Î³Â±Î¸Â±. However, if the rescaling is singular i.e.,Î³= 0 or Î³=âˆž, such simpliï¬cation is not possible.
 This occurs the case where Scoincides with an apparent horizon as will be discussed in Â§6.6.
 20light-sheet, say L+withÎ¸Ë†+â‰¤0, small deformations of the surface YAintoY1andY2
 (sketched in Fig. 2) always yield the inequality Area( Y1)â‰¤Area(YA)â‰¤Area(Y2). Among
 inï¬nitely many choices of such surfaces YA, we single out the one whose area becomes the
 minimum. Of course, there is no minimal surface if we search a ll surfaces with the same
 boundary condition due to the Lorentzian signature. The add itional condition ( 3.14) of the
 non-positive expansions along both light-sheets is crucia l for the existence of this minimum.
 Now pick a generic surface YAtwhich is not necessarily the minimal one, such that the
 null expansions are negative everywhere on YAt. We expect that such a surface reaches in
 further than the minimal surface, as can be checked by examin ing explicit examples in Â§5.
 As is clear from the formula ( 3.13), if we slightly deform the surface towards the boundary,
 its area decreases because Î¸Ë†Â±â‰¤0. We will be able to continue this deformation until both
 of the expansions become zero. The surface obtained in this w ay has the area which is
 minimum among those surfaces which allow the light-sheet co nstruction. The validity of the
 assumed structure of expansions which allows such a deforma tion can be conï¬rmed in an
 explicit example of AdS 3, as shown in the Fig. 3inÂ§5.1.3.
 The above procedure constructs the surface whose null expan sions are both vanishing.
 As we have seen in Â§3.2, this means that this surface obtained from the minimizatio n
 procedure ( 3.6) is equivalent to the extremal surface deï¬ned by the station ary point of
 the area functional. Clearly this argument of equivalence i s rather speculative; we leave a
 rigorous proof as an interesting problem for the future. To s ummarize, we have obtained the
 following proposal:
 Covariant holographic entanglement entropy proposal (II) :We claim that the holo-
 graphic entanglement entropy for a region Ais given by
 SA=Area(Yext)
 4G(d+1)
 N, (3.15)
 where Yextis a co-dimension two surface in Mwhich has zero null geodesic expansions, i.e.,
 bothÎ¸Â±vanish on Yext, and which satisï¬es âˆ‚Yext=âˆ‚A. If this surface is not unique, we
 choose the one whose area is minimum among all such surfaces h omotopically equivalent to
 A. Also by virtue of ( 3.13) and the discussion of Appendix B, we have Yext=W. So we can
 just as well replace Area( Yext) in (3.15) by Area( W) without loss of generality. Henceforth
 we will drop the subscript â€˜extâ€™ on Yextand simply denote the surface with vanishing null
 expansions by Y.
 4 Relations between covariant constructions
 In the previous section we have motivated a covariant prescr iption for calculating the holo-
 graphic entanglement entropy using light-sheets, in analo gy with the covariant entropy
 21bounds. This construction involves ï¬nding a surface Yextwith vanishing null expansions,
 which as we discuss, is equivalent to the extremal surface W. We have also hitherto intro-
 duced another natural covariant surface: a minimal surface on a maximal slice, X.
 In this section, after we show that the covariant proposal ( 3.15) can indeed be also
 derived from the basic principle of AdS/CFT, we will proceed to discuss the detailed relations
 between W(=Yext) andX.
 4.1 Equivalence of WandYvia variational principles
 In the time-dependent setup discussed in Â§2.3, we can directly apply the Lorentzian GKP-W
 relation (see e.g., [49]) as long as the UV limit of the theory becomes conformal. Ass uming
 that the boundary ï¬eld theory is in a pure state, we have the pa th-integral expressions for
 the reduced density matrix analogous to the situation in Â§2.2:
 [ÏA(t)]Î±Î²=/integraltext
 DÏ• eiSsugra(Ï•)âˆa\}bâˆ‡acketle{tÎ²|Ï•(tâˆ’Ç«)âˆa\}bâˆ‡acketâˆ‡i}htâˆa\}bâˆ‡acketle{tÏ•(t+Ç«)|Î±âˆa\}bâˆ‡acketâˆ‡i}ht/integraltext
 DÏ• eiSsugra(Ï•), (4.1)
 The boundary conditions (which will be implemented on a suit able cut-oï¬€ surface) Ï•=Ï•Â±
 are the ones induced from the â€˜indicesâ€™ Ï•Â±of the density matrix [ ÏA(t)]Ï•+Ï•âˆ’. This is a
 Lorentzian generalization of the argument in [ 27], where the proposal of [ 24,10] was ï¬rst
 proven.
 The CFT partition function Znin (2.14) is now holographically equivalent to the partition
 function Zsugra
 nof the supergravity on the dual manifold Mnwhich is obtained by solving
 Einstein equations while requiring that it approaches âˆ‚Mnat the boundary. Since the
 original manifold âˆ‚Mnincludes the singular surface âˆ‚Awith a negative deï¬cit angle 2 Ï€(1âˆ’
 n), its holographical extension Mnhas the co-dimension two deï¬cit angle surface W. If we
 employ the tree level supergravity approximation, the acti on can be estimated10by

 In this way, after taking the derivative with respect to nas in ( 2.15), we obtain the
 holographic formula
 SA=Area(W)

 This completes the derivation of the holographic formula ( 3.15) of the entanglement entropy
 in time-dependent backgrounds. Since a diï¬€erential geomet rical analysis shows W=Yext
 (see Appendix B), the above derivation may be viewed as a heuristic proof of o ur covariant
 proposal.
 4.2 Equivalence of XandYon totally geodesic surfaces
 In motivating the existence of a covariant formulation of ho lographic entanglement entropy,
 we argued that one could in principle choose a preferred slic ing of the bulk corresponding to
 the maximal area slices and then use the holographic entangl ement entropy proposal of [ 24,
 10]. We will argue that while the maximal surfaces Xdonâ€™t generically coincide with WorY,
 there is a special case wherein this proposal for Xis equivalent to the covariant entanglement
 entropy proposal for Yformulated in terms of the light-sheets and the expansion al ong null
 geodesic congruences. The speciï¬c restriction on the maxim al slices which turns out to be
 relevant is the notion of â€œtotally geodesic submanifoldâ€.
 To examine this issue, it is useful to recall a few geometric f acts related to foliation of
 spacetimes and extrinsic curvatures. For a co-dimension on e spacelike sub-manifold Î£ in M,
 anchored at some time tinâˆ‚M, with Ï„Âµâ‰¡(âˆ‚Ï„)Âµbeing the unit timelike normal to Î£, we
 deï¬ne the induced metric on Î£:
 Î³ÂµÎ½=gÂµÎ½+Ï„ÂµÏ„Î½, (4.4)
 and extrinsic curvature:
 KÂµÎ½=Î³Ï
 ÂµÎ³Ïƒ
 Î½âˆ‡ÏÏ„Ïƒ. (4.5)
 Here and in the following, âˆ‡Âµwill denote the covariant derivative with respect to the ful l
 bulk metric gÂµÎ½. Now, we can look for a minimal surface Sin Î£. For such a putative minimal
 surface S, letsÂµdenote the unit spacelike normal to Slying within Î£, so that sÂµÏ„Âµ= 0
 everywhere. Then we can again deï¬ne the induced metric on the surface S:
 hÂµÎ½=Î³ÂµÎ½âˆ’sÂµsÎ½, (4.6)
 and the extrinsic curvature of Sin Î£:
 Ï€ÂµÎ½=hÏ
 ÂµhÏƒ
 Î½DÏsÏƒ, (4.7)
 where DÂµis the covariant derivative with respect to the metric Î³ÂµÎ½on Î£, which is related to
 the spacetime covariant derivative by projection from M:
 DÂµsÎ½=Î³Ï
 ÂµÎ³Ïƒ
 Î½âˆ‡ÏsÏƒ. (4.8)
 This implies that
 Ï€ÂµÎ½=hÏ
 ÂµhÏƒ
 Î½âˆ‡ÏsÏƒ. (4.9)
 23We now turn to the question of interest: assuming that Sis a minimal surface on the
 particular slice Î£ corresponding to the maximal slice of M, under what conditions does the
 null geodesic expansion along NÂµâˆÏ„ÂµÂ±sÂµvanish?
 Since we assume that Î£ is a maximal slice, we necessarily have KÂµ
 Âµ= 0,i.e., the trace
 of the extrinsic curvature vanishes everywhere on Î£, which i mplies that
 âˆ‡ÂµÏ„Âµ= 0. (4.10)
 Similarly, the constraint that Sis a minimal surface in Î£ implies that Ï€Âµ
 Âµ= 0, which leads
 to the identity
 âˆ‡ÂµsÂµ=sÎ½Ï„Âµâˆ‡ÂµÏ„Î½. (4.11)
 Having extracted the two relations implied by Î£ being the max imal slice in MandSbeing
 the minimal surface in Î£, we now turn to evaluate the null expa nsions Î¸Â±. Using ( 3.12) with
 NÂµ
 Â±âˆÏ„ÂµÂ±sÂµ, we obtain:
 Î¸Â±âˆKÂµ
 ÂµÂ±Ï€Âµ
 Âµâˆ’sÎ½sÂµâˆ‡ÂµÏ„Î½=Ï„Î½sÂµâˆ‡ÂµsÎ½ (4.12)
 where the second equality used KÂµ
 Âµ= 0,Ï€Âµ
 Âµ= 0 and sÂµÏ„Âµ= 0. So Î¸Â±will vanish provided
 we have Ï„Î½sÂµâˆ‡ÂµsÎ½= 0, which is equivalent to the condition KÂµÎ½sÂµsÎ½= 0.
 Thus we see that for the null geodesic congruence to have vani shing expansion, it does
 not suï¬ƒce for the surface Î£ to be a maximal slice. We must in add ition require that
 KÂµÎ½sÂµsÎ½= 0. This is satisï¬ed only11when KÂµÎ½= 0 since the vector sÂµcan be taken to be
 arbitrary. Such a surface is called a totally geodesic subma nifold, and it describes a surface
 whose geodesics are also geodesics of the entire spacetime. One can quickly intuit this by
 noting that if sÂµwere tangent to a geodesic then sÂµâˆ‡ÂµsÏƒâˆsÏƒ, which by virtue of sÂµÏ„Âµ= 0
 will imply the vanishing of Î¸Â±. This leads to the following claim:
 Claim: Assume that a maximal spacelike surface Î£ t(anchored at a constant time ton
 âˆ‚M) is totally geodesic. Then the minimal surface Xon Î£ tis equivalent to the surface
 Yextin the covariant entanglement entropy prescription of Â§3.3. However, if we require Î£ t
 to be totally geodesic for all t,i.e.if the spacetime Mallows a totally geodesic foliation,
 then the spacetime must be static. This is because the condit ionKÂµÎ½= 0 means that
 the hypersurface orthogonal timelike vector Ï„Âµis in fact a Killing vector. In this case, the
 covariant construction reduces to the minimal surface pres cription ( 2.2).
 Hence we see that the covariant entanglement entropy candid ateXreproduces the â€˜cor-
 rectâ€™ prescription W=Yfor all time only in the trivial case of static bulk geometrie s.
 However, if we relax the requirement of full foliation of Mby totally geodesic slices, but
 11Note that while KÂµÎ½sÂµsÎ½= 0 only picks out the symmetric part of KÂµÎ½, the antisymmetric part is
 automatically guaranteed to vanish whenever Ï„Âµis hypersurface orthogonal, i.e.Ï„[Âµâˆ‡Î½Ï„Ï]= 0, which is the
 present case.
 24rather achieve KÂµÎ½= 0 on a single slice, say at t= 0, then we still have12Xt=0=Yt=0. For
 example, in a spacetime with time reversal symmetry tâ†” âˆ’t, at time t= 0 we can compute
 the entanglement entropy by using the minimal surface Xt=0in Î£ t=0(in this case the t= 0
 slice).
 5 Consistency checks for time-independent backgrounds
 Thus far we have kept our discussion at a reasonably abstract level; we have formulated
 a clear algorithm for constructing the bulk surface whose ar ea captures the entanglement
 entropy associated with the boundary region Ain question. A simple consistency check of
 our picture is that the covariant proposal should reduce to t he holographic entanglement
 entropy proposal of [ 24,10] whenever the bulk spacetime is static. To make contact with
 that discussion, we examine several examples of asymptotic ally AdS static spacetimes. This
 also allows us to see explicitly the equivalence between the light-sheet construction Yand
 the extremal surface proposal W, thereby making explicit the arguments of Â§3.1andÂ§3.3.
 Finally we will turn to an example of a stationary spacetime ( rotating BTZ geometry) to
 illustrate the shortcomings of the minimal surface on a maxi mal slice prescription XofÂ§2.3.
 5.1 AdS 3
 First consider the AdS 3geometry described by the PoincarÂ´ e metric
 ds2=âˆ’dt2+dx2+dz2
 z2. (5.1)
 We begin by studying the null expansions for a co-dimension t wo surface by choosing a
 particular ansatz and compute the covariant holographic en tanglement entropy.
 5.1.1 Expansions of null geodesics
 A general co-dimension two curve Sin (5.1) is described by the constraint functions
 Ï•1=tâˆ’G(z), Ï• 2=xâˆ’F(z). (5.2)
 The normalized null vectors orthogonal to Sare then given by the following linear combina-
 tions
 (NÂ±)Âµ=NgÂµÎ½(âˆ‡Î½Ï•1+ÂµÂ±âˆ‡Î½Ï•2), (5.3)
 12In this case we can easily prove the strong subadditivity of h olographic entanglement entropy [ 25] as
 in [26] since two minimal surfaces on the same time slice can inters ect with each other if they do so at the
 boundary of AdS.

 5.1.2 Extremal surface and holographic entanglement entro py
 While we have written the expression for expansions for a gen eral curve Sin AdS 3parame-
 terized as ( 5.2), by virtue of time translation invariance, we expect that t he desired extremal
 surface (curve) lies on a constant tslice. Let us therefore concentrate on a curve S0in (5.1)
 with no temporal variation, by requiring G(z) = 0. Then the expansions for S0are simpliï¬ed
 to
 Î¸+=âˆ’Î¸âˆ’=âˆ’z Fâ€²â€²(z) +Fâ€²(z) +Fâ€²(z)3

 0 are unchanged. The geodesic expansion scales like the null vectors i.e.,Î¸+â†’Î³ Î¸+andÎ¸âˆ’â†’Î³âˆ’1Î¸âˆ’.
 Because we are interested in the condition Î¸Â±= 0, this non-zero scale factor is inconsequential except so me
 singular cases where apparent horizons exist.
 14One can check that the three-metric ( 5.5) is degenerate, as required. For purposes of computing the
 expansions, it is more useful to work with this degenerate th ree-metric rather than the one-metric on the
 curve, to ensure the correct projections of âˆ‡ÂµNÎ½.
 26Notice that the expansion in the time direction is vanishing ,i.e.,Î¸++Î¸âˆ’= 0, because the
 spacetime is static.
 To ï¬nd the covariant holographic entanglement entropy cand idateYto utilize our pro-
 posal ( 3.15), we require that both null expansions vanish. This leads to the equation
 z Fâ€²â€²(z)âˆ’Fâ€²(z)âˆ’(Fâ€²(z))3= 0, (5.9)
 which determines the requisite surface. We can easily ï¬nd th e following simple solutions:
 F(z) =âˆš
 h2âˆ’z2, (5.10)
 where his an arbitrary non-negative constant. This means that the h alf circle x2+z2=h2
 (z >0) is the curve YAresponsible for the entanglement entropy when we choose the
 subsystem Ato be an interval with length 2 h.
 As can be easily veriï¬ed, this curve also describes a spaceli ke geodesic in AdS 3and
 likewise corresponds to the minimal surface on the constant tslice. This makes explicit the
 assertion made earlier that minimal surfaces on a constant t ime slice in a static spacetimes
 have vanishing null expansions. Hence we have veriï¬ed, for t he AdS 3example, that WA=
 XA=YAfor any region A, and given an explicit equation for this surface. To compute
 the holographic dual of the entanglement entropy SAitself, we need to calculate the proper
 length along this bulk surface.
 The length LofYAis found to be
 L= 2h/integraldisplayh
 Îµdz

 h2âˆ’z2= 2 log2h
 Îµ, (5.11)
 where Îµis the lattice spacing corresponding to the UV cut-oï¬€. Using the relation between
 the central charge of the dual CFT and the bulk Newtonâ€™s const antc=3
 2G(3)
 N[50], we obtain
 the expression in the dual CFT language
 SA=L
 4G(3)
 N=c

 Îµ. (5.12)
 This reproduces the well-known formula in 2D conformal ï¬eld theory [ 6,5].
 5.1.3 Structure of the sign of expansions
 The signs of expansions of null geodesics are directly relat ed to the change of the area of a
 given spacelike surface under an inï¬nitesimal deformation as the formula ( 3.13) shows. In
 this subsection, we discuss how the signs of the expansions c hange in explicit examples.
 We start with the 3 dimensional ï¬‚at spacetime R1,2:ds2=âˆ’dt2+dx2+dz2. If we
 consider the curve t= constant and x=F(z), the null vectors NÂµ
 Â±are given by the formula
 27(5.3) with the modiï¬cation that Nof (5.4) now becomes N=âˆš
 1+Fâ€²2âˆš
 2(1+Fâ€²2+Gâ€²2). The expansions
 are found to be
 Î¸+=âˆ’Î¸âˆ’=âˆ’Fâ€²â€²(z)âˆš
 2 (1 + Fâ€²(z)2)3/2. (5.13)
 In the particular case of the circle x2+z2=h2, we ï¬nd Î¸+=âˆ’Î¸âˆ’=1âˆš
 2h>0 when xâ‰¥0.
 When xis negative we obtain the opposite result.
 From the formula ( 3.13) and the normalization ( N+)Âµ(Nâˆ’)Âµ=âˆ’1, we ï¬nd that Î¸Â±
 measure the increase of area under the inï¬nitesimal deforma tionsÎ´XÂµâˆ âˆ’NÂµ
 âˆ“. The signs
 Î¸Ë†+â‰¡ âˆ’Î¸+<0 and Î¸Ë†âˆ’â‰¡Î¸âˆ’<0 for the circle can be intuited directly as the null vector
 NË†+=âˆ’N+is ingoing along the future light-cone and NË†âˆ’=Nâˆ’is ingoing along the past
 light-cone. We thus see that the past and future light-cones emanating from the circle are
 examples of light-sheets as we have explained in ( 3.14) (see Fig. 1). Note also that Î¸+âˆ’Î¸âˆ’>0
 means that the expansion in the spacelike direction is posit ive, which illustrates the basic
 fact that the length of the circle increases as the radius hbecomes larger.
 Now we move on to the more interesting case ( 5.1) of AdS 3. The null expansions for static
 curves are already computed in ( 5.8). On the curve deï¬ned by the ellipse x2+b2z2=h2for
 a positive constant b, we ï¬nd that when xâ‰¥0 (for x <0 the result has the signs reversed),
 Î¸+=âˆ’Î¸âˆ’=b4(1âˆ’b2)z3
 âˆš
 2 (h2+b2(b2âˆ’1)z2)3/2. (5.14)
 Thus the expansions of ingoing null geodesics Î¸Ë†+=âˆ’Î¸+andÎ¸Ë†âˆ’=Î¸âˆ’are negative when
 b <1,i.e., when the curve goes deep into the IR region, while it becomes positive when b >1.
 Furthermore, the expansions in AdS 3are vanishing when the curve is a half-circle, which
 coincides with the minimal surface. Thus we conclude that th e null geodesic congruences on
 this ellipse can be used as light-sheets only when bâ‰¤1.
 In the AdS 3background we can notice one more interesting fact: for any c urve on the
 light-cone, one of the two null expansions is vanishing, as w ill also be shown in Â§5.2.3. For
 example, if we consider an arbitrary curve on the future ligh t-cone t=âˆ’âˆš
 x2+z2, it turns
 out that Î¸Ë†+= 0 when xâ‰¥0, while Î¸Ë†âˆ’= 0 when x <0. This property can be easily
 generalized to higher dimensional AdS spaces. The behavior of expansions Î¸Ë†Â±inAdS 3is
 summarized in Fig. 3.
 In this way we observed that in (asymptotically) AdS spaceti mes, the expansions of null
 geodesics can change their sign at the speciï¬c points in the b ulk. This property clearly plays
 a crucial role in our holographic computation of entangleme nt entropy.
 5.2 Higher dimensional examples: AdS d+1
 We can repeat the above computations of null expansions for A dSd+1(3.2). In these higher
 dimensional examples, there are many diï¬€erent choices for t he shape of region A. Working

 to the plane x= 0assuming a particular series of curves whose null expansion s each take the
 same sign at any points. The shaded region denotes the region where two light-sheets exist.
 in PoincarÂ´ e coordinates we can choose an arbitrary region o n the boundary R1,dâˆ’1and in
 principle ï¬gure out the associated extremal surfaces. For s implicity, we will concentrate on
 speciï¬c two examples, where we assume the subsystem Ain the dual CFT is given by (i) an
 inï¬nite strip and (ii) a spherical ball in R1,dâˆ’1.
 5.2.1 Inï¬nite strip in AdS d+1
 On the boundary of AdS d+1in PoincarÂ´ e coordinates we choose the region Ato be an inï¬nite
 strip deï¬ned as
 A:={(t,/vector x)|t= 0,|x1| â‰¤h, x i= arbitrary for i= 2, . . ., d âˆ’1}. (5.15)
 Here we have singled out one of the spatial coordinates in R1,dâˆ’1called x1to take values in
 ï¬nite range. To ï¬nd the associated extremal surface in the bu lk, we choose an ansatz for
 co-dimension two surface in AdS d+1by the two constraints ( 5.2), with a trivial relabeling
 x1â†’x. We require that when restricted to the boundary zâ†’0, the extremal surface is
 reduced to the boundary âˆ‚Aof inï¬nite strip.
 29The null expansions of this surface can be shown to be (here Ëœd=dâˆ’1)

 5.2.2 3-dimensional ball in AdS 5
 Our previous examples have focussed on planar symmetry and w e now turn to an example
 where the region Aof interest is a ball in Rdâˆ’1âŠ‚R1,dâˆ’1with radius h. The region Ais
 given as (for simplicity we choose t= 0)
 A:=/braceleftbig

 An ansatz for surfaces which respect the spherical symmetry is given by
 Ï•1=tâˆ’G(z), Ï• 2=Î¾âˆ’F(z). (5.22)
 30Further imposing the staticity inherited from the backgrou nd leads to the simpliï¬cation15
 G(z) = 0. For the particular case of AdS 5the null vectors normalized according to our usual

 One can check these null expansions vanish for the minimal su rface

 The entanglement entropy associated with the region Aof (5.20) can be calculated from the
 area of this surface. As expected, the surface ( 5.26) coincides with the minimal surface of [ 10].
 We refer the interested reader to [ 10] for a detailed discussion of the area and comparisons of
 the holographic entanglement entropy thus obtained to the ï¬ eld theory calculations at weak
 coupling.
 5.2.3 Area and expansion of surfaces on the light-cone
 InÂ§3.2we presented the relation between the change in the area of a s pacelike surface
 under a small deformation and the expansions of the null geod esics. Here we would like to
 understand this relation geometrically in the speciï¬c exam ple of AdS d+1.
 Consider the set-up of the inï¬nite strip region on the bounda ry as in Â§5.2.1and take
 a surface which inï¬nitely extends in the directions x2, x3,Â·Â·Â·, xdâˆ’1. Such surfaces can be
 15One can evaluate the expansions for non-zero G(z) just as easily and check that the surface given in
 (5.26) does indeed have vanishing expansions.
 31described by the ansatz ( 5.2), with xâ†’x1. We would like to concentrate on the case where
 the surfaces lie on the light-cone16t2=x2
 1+z2. These can be parameterized as
 x1=p(s) cos(s), z =p(s) sin(s), t (s) =hâˆ’p(s), (5.27)
 with the boundary condition p(0) = p(Ï€) =h.
 The area of any of these surfaces given by a particular choice ofp(s) is expressed as
 Area(Y) =/integraldisplayÏ€âˆ’Ç«2
 Ç«1ds
 sindâˆ’1(s)p(s)dâˆ’2. (5.28)
 where the boundary condition on the cut-oï¬€ surface z=Îµis being implemented through the
 boundary condition z(s=Ç«1,2) =Îµ.
 When d= 2, the expression ( 5.28) does not depend on the function p(s) which represents
 the choice of the curve. This means that the deformation of an y curve on a light-cone in
 AdS 3does not change its area (as long as we neglect the UV cut-oï¬€). This nicely agrees
 with the fact that the expansion along the light-sheet is van ishing for any curve on it, as
 mentioned in Â§5.1.3. If we consider the opposite light-cone t+h=/radicalbig
 x2
 1+z2, we can ï¬nd
 that on the half circle deï¬ned by x2
 1+z2=h2,t= 0 and z >0, the null expansions are both
 vanishing, i.e.this is an extremal surface as we noticed in ( 5.10).
 On the other hand, in higher dimensions d >2, the area becomes dependent on p(s).
 Furthermore, we can see the inequality Area( Y1)>Area(YA)>Area(Y2) where the surfaces
 are labeled in accord with the conventions of Fig. 2. This in particular shows that the ingoing
 expansion along this light-cone t=âˆ’/radicalbig
 x2
 1+z2is positive. Thus we can conclude that we
 cannot regard the light-cone ( 5.27) as a light-sheet in d >2. This fact can also be conï¬rmed
 by direct evaluation of the expansions using ( 5.16).
 5.3 BTZ black hole (non-rotating)
 Our next example will be one which is not globally static, but one which has a horizon and
 a static patch extending out to the boundary. Consider the BT Z black hole, with a mass
 proportional to m, in the PoincarÂ´ e coordinates [ 51], [19]
 ds2=âˆ’(r2âˆ’m)dt2+dr2
 (r2âˆ’m)+r2dx2. (5.29)
 We will pick the region Aon the boundary R1,1with coordinates ( t, x) to be at a constant
 tslice and a ï¬nite interval in xwith|x| â‰¤h. One can again take as an ansatz for the
 extremal surface ( 5.2) and compute the expansions to derive the diï¬€erential equat ions for
 16The light-cone in question is the ï¬‚at space light-cone by vir tue of the PoincarÂ´ e metric ( 3.2) being
 conformally ï¬‚at.
 32the functions G(z) and F(z). It is however simpler to exploit the fact that the extremal
 surfaces in AdS 3are spacelike geodesics on a constant tslice and ï¬nd the relevant surface
 directly.
 Therefore we would like to ï¬nd the spacelike geodesics of the formt= constant and
 r=r(x) in order to calculate the entanglement entropy. The conser vation equation resulting
 from the the fact that âˆ‚xis a Killing ï¬eld leads to a constant Hamiltonian:

 Lreg=Lâˆ’2 log(2 râˆž)â‰ƒ2âˆšm h , (5.34)
 which can be interpreted as the length of a part of the horizon .17
 Using the relation between the mass and the inverse temperat ureÎ²=2Ï€âˆšm[51,19], we

 5.4 Star in AdS 5
 Our ï¬nal example of a static spacetime is the 5-dimensional A dS radiation star background18
 considered in [ 52],
 ds2=âˆ’f(r)dt2+h(r)dr2+r2dâ„¦2

 and the mass density Ï(r), deï¬ned by Ttt=Ï(r)f(r), is related to the mass function by

 0Ï(Â¯r) Â¯r3dÂ¯r. (For further details, see [ 52].)
 We consider the entanglement entropy deï¬ned by dividing the S3into two hemispheres
 AandB. The minimal surface for SAis clearly given by the largest two-sphere âˆ‚Atimes
 the radial direction r. Thus its area is given by
 Area = 4 Ï€/integraldisplayâˆž

 We are interested in the diï¬€erence âˆ† SAbetween the entanglement entropy for the region A
 in the star geometry ( 5.36),(5.37) and in pure AdS 5. This diï¬€erence will capture the excess
 entanglement by virtue of the state of the boundary theory be ing an excited state of the
 CFT, and in a sense provide a measure of how many degrees of fre edom are excited (and
 entangled) in the region in question. One can check that âˆ† SAis ï¬nite and positive; the

 5.5 Stationary spacetimes: the rotating BTZ geometry
 Our ï¬nal example of a spacetime with a timelike Killing ï¬eld ( outside ergo-regions) will
 be a rotating black hole spacetime. We will use this example t o illustrate the inadequacy
 of the min-max proposal of Â§2.3, providing a more robust conï¬rmation of our light-sheet
 construction discussed in Â§3.3.
 5.5.1 The holographic computation of entanglement entropy
 We consider 3 dimensional Kerr-AdS solution ( i.e., rotating BTZ black hole) and compute
 the holographic entanglement entropy for a ï¬nite interval o n the boundary. In this example,
 as we will see one can no longer assume any constant time slice on which the extremal curve
 lives.
 The metric is given by
 ds2=âˆ’(r2âˆ’r2
 +) (r2âˆ’r2
 âˆ’)
 r2dt2+r2
 (r2âˆ’r2
 +) (r2âˆ’r2
 âˆ’)dr2+r2/parenleftï£¬ig
 dx+r+râˆ’
 r2dt/parenrightï£¬ig2
 ,(5.40)
 where the coordinate xis compactiï¬ed as xâˆ¼x+land we assume r+â‰¥râˆ’. The mass M
 and angular momentum Jof this black hole becomes
 8G(3)M=r2
 ++r2
 âˆ’, J =r+râˆ’
 4G(3). (5.41)
 If we set râˆ’= 0, then the angular momentum becomes zero and the black hole (5.40)
 becomes identical the static example ( 5.29) discussed in Â§5.3by setting m=r2
 +.
 This rotating black hole background ( 5.40) is dual to a 1+1 dimensional CFT on a circle
 at ï¬nite temperature Î²âˆ’1with a potential â„¦ for the momentum. The radius of the circle i s
 deï¬ned to be land we assume that the system is at a very high temperature ( Î²â‰ªl). The
 potential â„¦ is conjugate to the angular momentum of the rotat ing black hole.
 The temperature and the potential in the dual CFT are found fr om the relations
 Î²Â±â‰¡Î²(1Â±â„¦) =2Ï€ l
 âˆ†Â±,âˆ†Â±â‰¡r+Â±râˆ’. (5.42)
 35The dual CFT is then described by the density matrix
 Ï=eâˆ’Î² H+Î²â„¦P, (5.43)
 where HandPare the Hamiltonian and the momentum of the CFT. Equivalentl y we can
 regard Î²Â±=Î²(1Â±â„¦) as the inverse temperatures for the left and right-moving modes.
 To obtain the geodesics explicitly, it is convenient to reme mber that all BTZ black holes
 are locally equivalent to the pure AdS 3. Explicitly, this map is given by ( cf., [53])
 wÂ±=/radicalï£¬igg

 âˆ’ex r++t râˆ’. (5.44)
 This maps the metric ( 5.40) to the PoincarÂ´ e metric
 ds2=dw+dwâˆ’+dz2
 z2. (5.45)
 We know that the spacelike geodesics in pure AdS 3(5.45) are given by the half circles of the
 form ( Xâˆ’Xâˆ—)2+z2=h2on a constant Tslice and their boosts wÂ±â†’Î³Â±1wÂ±. Indeed, by
 mapping these geodesics in pure AdS 3into the rotating black hole, we can obtain the relevant
 extremal surface. Note that despite the spacetime being jus t stationary, the extremal surface
 W=Yextis indeed given by spacelike geodesics.
 Thus we can assume that a series of spacelike geodesics in AdS 3are all situated on some
 spacelike hypersurface
 Î³ w+âˆ’Î³âˆ’1wâˆ’= const. (5.46)
 Since we are considering the subsystem Awhich is an interval at a ï¬xed time t0, the value
 oftshould be the same at the two endpoints of the geodesic. If we d eï¬ne the value of xat
 the endpoints by x1andx2, this requirement leads to the constraint
 Î³2e(x1+t0)âˆ†+âˆ’e(x1âˆ’t0)âˆ†âˆ’=Î³2e(x2+t0)âˆ†+âˆ’e(x2âˆ’t0)âˆ†âˆ’. (5.47)
 The geodesic length in AdS 3(5.45) leads to the holographic entanglement entropy SA=

 3logâˆ†x
 Îµwhen the length of the interval Aon the boundary is âˆ† xas we have seen in Â§5.1.
 The UV cut-oï¬€ z=Îµis mapped to the cut-oï¬€ in the background ( 5.40) via
 Îµ1,2=/radicalbig
 r2
 +âˆ’r2
 âˆ’
 râˆžer+x1,2+râˆ’t0, (5.48)
 where Îµ1,2denote the cut-oï¬€ at each of the two endpoints in ( 5.45). Further, the UV cut-oï¬€
 râˆžin (5.40) can be identiï¬ed with the cut-oï¬€ ( i.e., the lattice spacing) Îµin the dual CFT
 viarâˆž= 1/Îµ. The length of the interval âˆ† xis easily found to be
 (âˆ†x)2= âˆ†w+âˆ†wâˆ’=/parenleftbig

 eâˆ†âˆ’(x1âˆ’t0)âˆ’eâˆ†âˆ’(x2âˆ’t0)/parenrightbig
 . (5.49)
 36Putting these together we obtain the holographic entanglem ent entropy in the rotating
 BTZ geometry to be

 , (5.50)
 where âˆ† l= (x1âˆ’x2) is the length of the interval in the dual CFT. The ï¬nal answer is
 manifestly time-independent as required. Further, if we se t â„¦ = 0, then the above result
 reduces to the non-rotating BTZ answer ( 5.35).
 5.5.2 CFT and left-right asymmetric ensembles
 We would like to compare the holographic result ( 5.50) with the entanglement entropy cal-
 culated directly from two dimensional CFT in the ensemble ( 5.43). This can be done by
 exploiting the fact that the value Tr ( Ïn
 A) for the reduced density matrix ÏAfor the subsys-
 temAis equal to the two point function of twist operators whose co nformal dimension is
 âˆ†n=c
 24(nâˆ’1
 n) as shown in [ 5].
 For a CFT deï¬ned on a 2 dimensional non-compact plane (Euclid ean) and a region A
 whose boundaries are at u1andu2, one can show that
 Tr (Ïn
 A) =/parenleftbigg|u1âˆ’u2|
 Îµ/parenrightbiggâˆ’c
 6(nâˆ’1
 n)
 , (5.51)
 where Îµis the UV cut-oï¬€ in the CFT. This leads to the well-known formu la of the entangle-
 ment entropy at zero temperature
 SA=âˆ’âˆ‚
 âˆ‚nlog Tr ( Ïn

 Îµ. (5.52)
 To derive the result at ï¬nite Î²and â„¦ described by ( 5.43), we need to periodically identify
 the (Euclidean) two dimensional manifold on which the CFT is deï¬ned. The total partition
 function of this system is given by
 Z1= Tr/parenleftbig
 eâˆ’Î² H+iÎ²â„¦EP/parenrightbig
 , (5.53)
 where we deï¬ned â„¦ E=âˆ’iâ„¦. For the Euclidean CFT we will take â„¦ Eto be real as is
 conventional. This is achieved by the following conformal m ap

 2Ï€logw . (5.54)
 37Notice that the new coordinate wâ€²satisï¬es the periodicity wâ€²âˆ¼wâ€²+i Î²(1âˆ’iâ„¦E), in agreement
 with ( 5.53). Performing the conformal transformation, we ï¬nd
 Tr(Ïn

 where we have set âˆ† l=Î²(1âˆ’iâ„¦E)

 coordinate. After diï¬€erentiating with respect to nas in ( 5.52) and remembering the relation
 â„¦E=âˆ’iâ„¦, this precisely agrees with ( 5.50). It is also intriguing to notice that the expression
 factorizes into the left and right moving contributions: SA=SL
 A+SR
 A, suggesting a left-right
 decoupling in the two dimensional CFT.
 5.5.3 Comments on the min-max construction
 The prime reason for focusing on the rotating BTZ geometry is that it clariï¬es some of
 the arguments regarding the min-max proposal and the associ ated surface X. While we
 motivated the existence of a covariant construction using X, a minimal surface on a maximal
 slice, in Â§2.3, we subsequently argued that this prescription doesnâ€™t agr ee with the light-
 sheet construction of Â§3.3. In fact, we claimed in Â§4.2that the surfaces XandW(=YExt)
 generically agree only when the spacetime admits a totally g eodesic foliation.
 The rotating BTZ black hole has a Killing ï¬eld ( âˆ‚t)Âµwhich is timelike outside the ergo-
 regions, but is not hyper-surface orthogonal.19As a result, while it is true that surfaces of
 constant tare maximal, i.e., have KÂµ
 Âµ= 0, they do not contain the extremal surface W.
 This is also clear from the fact that constant tsurfaces are not everywhere spacelike. From
 our explicit construction of the geodesic ( 5.44) and ( 5.46) it is apparent that the geodesic
 moves in tdespite being pinned on the boundary at t=t0at both ends of the interval A.
 By an explicit CFT computation we have conï¬rmed that the cova riant holographic en-
 tanglement entropy obtained from the surface Wis indeed the correct one. While a priori
 it was plausible that the surface Xprovided the covariant generalization of the holographic
 entanglement entropy prescription, this example makes it m anifest that light-sheets or ex-
 tremal surfaces are crucial to capture the correct measure o f entanglement. This example
 should therefore be viewed as a strong support for our covari ant proposal.
 6 Entanglement entropy and time-dependence
 One of the motivations behind covariantizing the holograph ic entanglement entropy pro-
 posal was to be able to address the question of entanglement e ntropy in genuine time-
 19A necessary and suï¬ƒcient condition for a vector ï¬eld Î¾Âµto be hypersurface orthogonal is Î¾[Âµâˆ‡Î½Î¾Ï]= 0.
 It is easy to check that ( âˆ‚t)Âµdoesnâ€™t satisfy this condition in the metric ( 5.40).
 38dependent states. We will now turn to applying our proposal t o geometries with explicit
 time-dependence. By virtue of the AdS/CFT duality these spa cetimes will correspond to
 states in the CFT with non-trivial time evolution. However, we do not always have an ex-
 plicit CFT description of the state in question. While this h inders direct comparison of the
 results on time variation of the entanglement entropy from t he geometric perspective with
 ï¬eld theory, it nevertheless provides an interesting quali tative picture (which could be made
 quantitative once the dictionary between states in the ï¬eld theory and geometry becomes
 more explicit).
 6.1 Vaidya-AdS spacetimes
 One of the most important examples in time-dependent gravit ational backgrounds will be
 the black hole formation process via a collapse of some massi ve object. As a simplest such
 example, we would like to study the Vaidya background which d escribes the time-dependent
 process of a collapse of an idealized radiating star ( cf., [54]). The metric of d+1 dimensional
 Vaidya-AdS spacetime is given in PoincarÂ´ e coordinates as
 ds2=âˆ’/parenleftbigg
 r2âˆ’m(v)
 rdâˆ’2/parenrightbigg
 dv2+ 2dv dr+r2dâˆ’1/summationdisplay
 i=1dx2
 i, (6.1)
 and in global coordinate by
 ds2=âˆ’/parenleftbigg
 r2+ 1âˆ’m(v)
 rdâˆ’2/parenrightbigg
 dv2+ 2dv dr+r2dâ„¦2
 dâˆ’1. (6.2)
 If we assume that the function m(v) does not depend on the (light-cone) time v, then
 the background is exactly the same as the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole solution after a
 coordinate transformation. In this sense the Vaidya metric is a simple example of black hole
 with a time-dependent mass or temperature.
 The property of null geodesics in AdS Vaidya background has b een studied in [ 52] from
 the view point of AdS/CFT correspondence. The authors were i nterested in using the
 geodesics to compute singularities of boundary correlatio n functions. It was argued that
 the geodesic structure (which clearly probes the spacetime geometry) can be read oï¬€ from
 the correlation function and thus a map was provided between geometric information in the
 spacetime and the natural observables of the ï¬eld theory. In particular, it was shown how
 the ï¬eld theory correlation functions could be used to ascer tain the formation of a horizon
 in the bulk spacetime.
 Given that null geodesics can be used to decipher the map betw een ï¬eld theory ob-
 servables and geometry, a natural question is whether there is some more information to
 be gained from studying other geometric structures â€“ spacel ike geodesics or surfaces. We
 expect this to be generally the case, because in certain case s, such as in spacetimes with
 39null circular orbits, spacelike geodesics probe more easil y further into the bulk than null
 geodesics. Furthermore, null geodesics are manifestly ins ensitive to conformal rescaling of
 the spacetime, which is not the case for the spacelike ones. M otivated by these ideas we wish
 to ask whether the entanglement entropy of the boundary theo ry can be used as a non-local
 probe of the bulk geometry.
 Hence in the following we wish to calculate a time-dependent entanglement entropy in
 the Vaidya-AdS background. We will speciï¬cally focus on the 3-dimensional Vaidya-AdS
 metric
 ds2=âˆ’f(r, v)dv2+ 2dv dr+r2dx2, f(r, v)â‰¡r2âˆ’m(v), (6.3)
 for simplicity. The coordinate xcan be either non-compact (PoincarÂ´ e coordinate) or compac t
 (global coordinate). When m(v) is a constant m, this background is same as the BTZ black

 Below we would like to see how the entanglement entropy compu ted holographically changes
 under this time-evolution.
 6.2 Extremal surface in Vaidya-AdS
 In order to compute the holographic entanglement entropy, w e need to ï¬nd the minimal
 surface and then compute its area. The advantage of our examp le of the 3 dimensional
 Vaidya-AdS spacetime is that the minimal surface is the same as the spacelike geodesic. We
 can express the general geodesic by using (the non-aï¬ƒne) par ameterization
 Ï•1=râˆ’r(x) = 0, Ï• 2=vâˆ’v(x) = 0 . (6.7)
 We deï¬ne the subsystem Avat time vby the region âˆ’hâ‰¤xâ‰¤hso that it always has
 the width 2 h. In the dual gravity side, this leads to the following bounda ry condition along
 the geodesic:
 r(h) =r(âˆ’h) =râˆž, v (h) =v(âˆ’h) =v , (6.8)
 40where râˆžâ†’ âˆž is the UV cut-oï¬€ which is inversely related to the lattice spa cingÎµi.e.,
 râˆž= 1/Îµ. Note that we can require r(x) =r(âˆ’x) and v(x) =v(âˆ’x) due to the reï¬‚ection
 symmetry of the background.
 We would like to calculate the length Lof this geodesic
 L=/integraldisplayh

 r2+ 2râ€²vâ€²âˆ’f(r, v)vâ€²2, (6.9)
 where the derivative with respect to xis denoted by the primeâ€². This length functional
 being independent of x, we have a conserved quantity
 r4
 r2âˆ—=r2+ 2râ€²vâ€²âˆ’f(r, v)vâ€²2, (6.10)
 where râˆ—is a constant. In addition, we get two equations of motion for randvfrom the
 action principle. As usual, only one of them is independent o f the previous conservation
 equation ( 6.10). It is given by
 r2âˆ’r2(vâ€²)2âˆ’r vâ€²â€²+ 2vâ€²râ€²= 0. (6.11)
 Thus we have to solve these ODEs ( 6.10) and ( 6.11) in order to ï¬nd the geodesics. For
 a generic m(v), it is unfortunately not easy to ï¬nd an analytical solution . To obtain an ex-
 plicit example, we performed a numerical analysis in the spe ciï¬c case smoothly interpolating
 between pure AdS and BTZ,
 f(r, v) =r2âˆ’m0+ 1

 Roughly speaking, this corresponds to a null shell of charac teristic thickness vscollapsing to
 form a BTZ black hole of mass m0at time v= 0. We can numerically integrate to ï¬nd the
 spacelike geodesics in this geometry. For deï¬niteness, for the result shown below, we chose
 vs= 1 and m0= 1. (Note that in 3 dimensions, unlike in the higher dimensio nal analogs,
 the horizon starts at ï¬nite v; in this case v= 0.) Fig. 5shows several plots (snapshots for
 diï¬€erent times v(rmin)â‰¡v0as labeled) of a series of extremal surfaces.20As the horizon
 grows with increasing v, the plots look similar to diï¬€erent size static BTZ black hol es.
 6.3 Null expansions in Vaidya-AdS
 Having seen the behaviour of the spacelike geodesics which g ive us the requisite minimal
 surface, we next study the null expansions for the curve deï¬n ed by ( 6.7) in the three di-
 mensional Vaidya-AdS background ( 6.3). Consider a generic curve parameterized as in ( 6.7)
 20The surfaces will now vary in time as well; here we show just th erâˆ’xbehaviour. In fact, it is easy to
 conï¬rm that the extremal surface Wcannot coincide with the minimal surface on a maximal slice X. This
 follows simply from the fact that the geodesics anchored at c onstant von the boundary do not all lie on a
 single spacelike surface in the bulk Vaidya-AdS spacetime.

 42After some algebra we can show that both null expansions Î¸Â±are vanishing iï¬€ the equations
 of motion for the geodesic ( 6.10) and ( 6.11) are satisï¬ed. This justiï¬es our assertion in the
 previous sub-section that the extremal surface in question is given by a spacelike geodesic in
 Vaidya-AdS.
 6.4 Time-dependent entanglement entropy
 Having obtained the extremal surface Wfor the Vaidya-AdS geometry, we can compute the
 entanglement entropy of the region Ausing the area of W. In particular, we would now
 like to return to the original question about time-dependen ce of the entanglement entropy.
 If we assume that the time-dependence of the mass function m(v) in (6.3) is very weak,
 mâ€²(v)â‰ª1, then we can use the adiabatic approximation. First we comp ute the entropy for
 the static three dimensional AdS black hole ( i.e.BTZ) and then treat the mass as a function
 of time v.
 In the BTZ black hole background, the length of the geodesic i s given by the formula
 (5.33). The adiabatic approximation allows us to regard mas a time-dependent function
 m(v), so that the ï¬nite part of the geodesics length, denoted by Lreg(v), becomes
 Lreg(v) =L(v)âˆ’2 log(2 râˆž) = logsinh2(/radicalbig
 m(v)h)
 m(v). (6.17)
 When the mass is very small m(v)â‰ª1, (6.17) reduces to a regularized proper length as a
 function of (light-cone) time v:
 Lreg(v)â‰ƒ2 logh+h2
 3m(v). (6.18)
 Now let us recall the monotonicity property ( 6.6). If we combine it with the expression
 (6.17), we can show that the entanglement entropy increases in the adiabatic approximation.
 Hence assuming that the matter undergoing collapse to form t he black hole satisï¬es the null
 energy condition, it is clear from the adiabatic approximat ion that the entanglement entropy
 âˆ†SA(v)âˆLreg(v) increases in the process of a gravitational collapse.
 This claim can also be checked by a direct numerical analysis as shown in Fig. 6for the
 proï¬le ( 6.12). Not only is it apparent that the proper length increases mo notonically with
 time, but we can also see that the adiabatic formula ( 6.17) is actually quite accurate for
 vs= 1, m= 1. Note that there is a slight oï¬€set in the v-values between the two plots;
 presumably this is because of the dynamics, in particular th e identiï¬cation of the vvalues.
 However, if we shift the vvalue appropriately and overlay the two plots, the ï¬t is almo st
 perfect as shown in Fig. 7.
 Below we will see that the monotonicity property can be prove n via a direct perturbative
 analysis and furthermore that it is related to the second law of the black hole thermody-
 namics.

 446.5 Perturbative proof of entropy increase
 Consider the change of the area functional when the surface i s deformed slightly. The
 inï¬nitesimal shift of the dâˆ’1 dimensional spacelike surface Wis described by the deviation

 where gÎ±Î²=gÂµÎ½âˆ‚XÂµ
 âˆ‚Î¾Î±âˆ‚XÎ½
 âˆ‚Î¾Î²is the induced metric on the surface. Î²in the ï¬nal expression is
 orthogonal to the submanifold âˆ‚Wand Î  Î½is deï¬ned such that the equation of motion for
 this variational problem is given by Î  Î½= 0.
 This clearly shows that the area of extremal surface does not change under any inï¬nites-
 imal deformation provided we keep the same boundary conditi on or the surface Wis closed.
 However, since we are interested in changing the boundary co ndition, corresponding to the
 time-evolution, the ï¬nal term in ( 6.19), which comes from the boundary contribution via the
 partial integration, plays an important role.
 Let us now concentrate on the speciï¬c case of the three dimens ional Vaidya-AdS space-
 time and assume that Wvis the extremal surface at the asymptotic time vas in ( 6.8). The
 equation of motion vanishes on shell by deï¬nition; so only th e boundary term contributes
 and it can be written as:

 r=râˆž, (6.20)
 where the right hand side should be evaluated on the boundary with the cut-oï¬€ r=râˆž.
 The factor of two in ( 6.20) arises due to the two endpoints x=Â±h. To derive the above
 result, we set Î¾=rand use the fact g=grrâ‰ƒ1
 r2and the deviation Î´XÂµ=Î´v0(âˆ‚v)Âµ. As
 a consequence, we obtain the following expression for the ti me-dependence of the geodesic
 length for any choice of m(v):

 dr/parenrightbigg
 âˆ’1
 r2/bracketrightbigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
 r=râˆž. (6.21)
 Here we have used that the fact that in the UV limit r=râˆžâ†’ âˆž, the leading behavior
 of the relation between randvbecomes vâ‰ƒconstant âˆ’1
 r. This result ( 6.21) shows a
 remarkable fact that the time-dependence of the entangleme nt entropy only depends on the
 asymptotic form of the function v=v(r).
 To evaluate ( 6.21) explicitly, let us perform a perturbative analysis by assu ming that
 the time-dependent mass m(v) is very small and by keeping only its leading perturbation.
 45The details of this computation are described in the Appendi xC. The upshot is that the
 asymptotic expansion ofdv
 dris found using ( C.19), to be
 dv
 drâ‰ƒ1
 r2âˆ’h2mâ€²(v0)
 6r3+O(râˆ’4). (6.22)
 Plugging this into ( 6.20), we ï¬nally ï¬nd the time-dependence of the geodesic length
 dL(v)
 dv=h2mâ€²(v0)
 3â‰¥0. (6.23)
 This precisely agrees with the one obtained from an adiabati c argument ( C.15). Notice that
 this is non-negative when we impose the null energy conditio n (6.6).
 In this way we have conï¬rmed the monotonicity property of the entanglement entropy in
 the process of a gravitational collapse. It would be an inter esting problem to prove this for
 any general function m(v). We leave this for future investigation.
 6.6 Relation to the second law of black hole thermodynamics
 Up to now we have used holography to examine the entanglement entropy for a subsystem
 Avat a time vin a two dimensional theory. It is interesting to consider th e limit where the
 subsystem approaches the total space. In this limit, it turn s out that the extremal surface
 Wcovers the whole apparent horizon, as we will explain below. Thus the ï¬nite part of
 the holographic entanglement entropy is dominated by the co ntribution from the area of
 apparent horizon. The analogous result for static AdS black holes has been already obtained
 in [24,10]. When Avï¬nally coincides with the total system, the end points âˆ‚Avannihilate
 with each other and the extremal surface becomes the closed s urface deï¬ned by the apparent
 horizon at time vâˆ—, where vâˆ—is the limiting value of the coordinate von the extremal surface
 toward IR region.
 The (future) apparent horizon is deï¬ned by the boundary of a ( future) trapped surface
 [46]. In other words, on the apparent horizon the expansion Î¸outof the outgoing future-
 directed null geodesics is vanishing, while the other expan sionÎ¸inof the ingoing null geodesics
 is non-positive (see Fig. 8),
 Î¸out= 0, Î¸ inâ‰¤0. (6.24)
 Let us ï¬nd an apparent horizon in the Vaidya metric ( 6.3). Consider the particular class
 of co-dimension two surfaces deï¬ned by r= constant and v= constant. Then the null
 expansions can be read from ( 6.15) as follows:
 Î¸in=âˆ’Î¸+=âˆ’/radicalbig
 r2âˆ’m(v)âˆš
 2r, Î¸ out=âˆ’Î¸âˆ’=/radicalbig
 r2âˆ’m(v)âˆš

 Fig. 8: The behavior of the null geodesics near an apparent horizon.
 One might naively think the expansions of null geodesics are both vanishing at r=/radicalbig
 m(v).
 However, this is actually not true because we have not normal ized the null vectors NÂ±(6.13)
 such that they satisfy the geodesic equations NÂµ
 Â±âˆ‡ÂµNÎ½
 Â±= 0. The correct null vectors are
 given by
 NÂµ
 in=âˆ’(âˆ‚r)Âµ, NÂµ
 out= 2Î³(r, v) (âˆ‚v)Âµ+f(r, v)Î³(r, v) (âˆ‚r)Âµ, (6.26)
 where Î³(r, v) is a positive function determined as a solution to 2 âˆ‚vÎ³(r, v) +âˆ‚rÎ³(r, v) +
 2r Î³(r, v) = 0 which is smooth at r=/radicalbig
 m(v). The corresponding expansions of the null
 geodesic congruences then become
 Î¸in=âˆ’1
 r<0, Î¸ out=f(r, v)Î³(r, v)
 r. (6.27)
 With these correct normalizations we ï¬nd that the condition (6.24) for an apparent horizon
 is satisï¬ed at f(r, v) = 0. Thus we can conclude that r=/radicalbig
 m(v) is an apparent horizon
 in the 3-dimensional Vaidya-AdS metric. While in general in time-dependent backgrounds
 the apparent horizon does not coincide with the event horizo n, we are guaranteed that event
 horizon always lies outside the apparent horizon [ 46].
 In the above example, the formula ( 6.15) did not give the correct sign of the expansions,
 as the rescaling needed to satisfy the geodesic equation is s ingular. Since this occurs because
 f(r, v) =r2âˆ’m(v) vanishes on the apparent horizon, for generic curves which do not reach
 the apparent horizon this problem does not appear and we can r ead oï¬€ the correct sign of
 expansion from ( 6.15).
 Let us now return to the reason for the extremal surface Wto almost wrap the apparent
 horizon when the subsystem is taken to be as large as the total system. Finding the extremal
 surface is equivalent to solving for the vanishing null expa nsion given by ( 6.15); the apparent
 horizon provides a solution to this criterion, as is manifes t from ( 6.25). Thus we can conclude
 that the limit of the subsystem engulï¬ng the entire system, t he extremal surface appears
 47to coincide with a spatial section of the apparent horizon21(this fact can also be observed
 nicely in Fig. 5).
 Therefore we can argue that the total entropy Stot(t) =âˆ’TrÏ(t) logÏ(t) in the dual
 time-dependent theory is given by the area of the apparent ho rizon at t=vâˆ—. The time-
 dependence of Stotmeans that the evolution of the system is non-unitary; this i s the usual
 issue of evolution of a density matrix.22It is also interesting to note that for reproducing
 a physical quantity, the apparent horizon, which is deï¬ned u sing local quantities, is more
 crucial than the event horizon, whose deï¬nition is rather gl obal.
 The second law of black hole thermodynamics tells us that the area of apparent horizon
 always increases under any physical process which satisï¬es the appropriate energy condition
 [46] (also cf., [47]). This can be shown explicitly from the condition ( 6.24) and the basic
 formula ( 3.13), which guarantees that the area increases under an inï¬nite simal deformation
 Î´XÂµalong the evolution of the apparent horizon Î´XÂµâˆNÂµ
 outâˆ’NÂµ
 in. On the other hand,
 we can derive this second law of the apparent horizon area fro m the monotonicity property
 (6.23) by taking the mentioned limit of the minimal surface. In thi s way the two concepts
 are naturally connected with each other. Notice that on both sides the monotonicity stems
 from the positive energy condition.
 We note in passing that in the limit of the subsystem Aengulï¬ng the system, the temporal
 evolution of the extremal surface Wis captured by the behaviour of dynamical horizons . A
 dynamical horizon is deï¬ned to be a smooth, co-dimension one spacelike submani fold of the
 spacetime, which can be foliated by a family of closed spacel ike surfaces, such that the leaves
 of the foliation have one null expansion vanishing and the ot her null expansion being strictly
 negative [ 55,47] as in ( 6.24). It is tempting to infer from this that the results proved fo r the
 area increase of dynamical horizons can be ported to the pres ent situation and in particular
 used to establish a â€œsecond law of entanglement entropyâ€ fro m holographic considerations.
 21Strictly speaking, as we have argued above, the apparent hor izon is not a minimal surface. Moreover,
 the full apparent horizon is a bulk co-dimension one surface . We will interpret the fact that the extremal
 surface Wdips down almost all the way to the location of the apparent ho rizon and wraps the spatial section
 before returning back to the boundary to signify that the are a of the apparent horizon plays an important
 role in computing the entanglement entropy in the limit of th e subsytem Aapproaching the full system âˆ‚N.
 22One could try to interpret this as unitary evolution in a tens or product theory, where the second Hilbert
 space is hidden behind the horizon, as in the eternal AdS blac k hole [ 21]. Of course, in the dynamical situation
 we do not have exact thermal periodicity and this would imply that the â€˜shadow CFTâ€™ lives on a shifted
 locus in the complex time plane.

 7 Other examples of time-dependent backgrounds
 7.1 Wormholes in AdS and entanglement entropy
 Consider the (entanglement) entropy Stot=âˆ’TrÏtotlogÏtotfor the total system as in Â§6.6.
 It is vanishing if the system is in a pure state. When it is non- vanishing, it is usually
 interpreted as the thermal entropy and correspondingly its AdS dual spacetime is expected
 to have an event horizon. In such examples the total entropy Stotis dual to the Bekenstein-
 Hawking entropy of the black hole in question. In Lorentzian geometries such as the eternal
 Schwarzschild-AdS geometry, we can equivalently regard th e entropy as arising from the
 entanglement between the total system and another identica l system hidden behind the
 horizon as in [ 21] (cf., also [ 41] for other examples). A recent discussion of issues relevan t
 to this context can be found in [ 56].
 In this section we would like to point out an example which has a non-zero total entropy
 Stotand its origin seems to be diï¬€erent from the example mentione d above. In particular, the
 example we have in mind is an Euclidean spacetime with no even t horizons. These are the
 Euclidean AdS wormholes discussed in [ 40]. They are obtained by considering the hyperbolic
 slices of Euclidean AdS d+1(=Hd+1)
 dsHd+1=dÏ2+ cosh2Ï ds2
 Hd, (7.1)
 and by taking a quotient of Hdby a discrete group Î“ to generate a compact manifold.
 We mainly consider the case d= 2, because in this case the background is perturbatively
 stable [ 40]. Also the dual two dimensional CFT is well-deï¬ned on a backg round of negative
 curvature H2/Î“; a Riemann surface. The two boundaries âˆ‚M1andâˆ‚M2are given by the
 two limits Ïâ†’ âˆž andÏâ†’ âˆ’âˆž . After the quotient by the Fuchsian group Î“, the two
 boundaries become the same Riemann surface with genus gâ‰¥2 (see Fig. 9).
 Such a solution leads us to a puzzle23immediately as pointed out in [ 40]. From the CFT
 23There is another possibility that the path-integral over in ï¬nitely many such geometries cure the problem
 49side, we expect that the two CFTs on the two boundaries are dec oupled from each other.
 Thus all correlation functions between them should be vanis hing. However, from the gravity
 side, there are non-trivial correlations since the two boun daries are connected through the
 bulk.
 Here we would like to point out a possible resolution to this p roblem. Our claim is that
 the CFT 1onâˆ‚M1and the CFT 2onâˆ‚M2are actually entangled with each other despite
 the absence of an event horizon. To check CFT 1and CFT 2are indeed entangled, we need
 to compute the entanglement entropy S1for the total system of CFT 1. This should coincide
 with the entanglement entropy S2for the CFT 2(we expect that the total system CFT 1âˆª
 CFT 2to be in a pure state).
 When we choose a Euclidean time-direction locally in the two dimensional space âˆ‚M1,
 the total system (at a speciï¬c time) in CFT 1is deï¬ned by a circle Cinâˆ‚M1, which is
 topologically non-trivial. This setup can be regarded as a h igher genus generalization of the
 computation at a ï¬nite temperature using Euclidean BTZ blac k hole done in [ 10,24].
 Let us deï¬ne the circle Cminin the Riemann surface to be cycle with minimal length
 among those which are homotopic to C. Then the minimal surface which is relevant to the
 holographic computation of S1turns out to be the circle Cminat the throat Ï= 0. This
 can be understood as follows; see Fig. 9below. We ï¬rst consider the entropy SAassuming
 thatAis a submanifold of C. Then we can easily ï¬nd the minimal surface whose end point
 atÏ=âˆžcoincides with âˆ‚A. As we gradually increase the size of A, the minimal surface
 anchored on one boundary dips deeper into the bulk. In the lim itA â†’ C the two end points
 ofâˆ‚Aannihilate and the minimal surface gets localized at the thr oat. So the maximum
 entropy is given by the area of the neck. It is clear from the ge ometric picture that S1=S2,
 since both are measured by the area of the throat.
 In this way we ï¬nd that the entanglement entropy S1between CFT 1and CFT 2is given
 by
 S1=S2=Area(C)
 4G(3)
 N>0. (7.2)
 As this is clearly non-vanishing due to the throat connectin g the two boundaries, we can
 conclude that the two CFTs are entangled with each other. Int erestingly, the existence of
 such a minimal surface at the throat also plays the crucial ro le when we present a generic
 deï¬nition of wormhole as discussed in [ 57].
 The above deï¬nition of entanglement entropy between two CFT s only depends on the
 topological class of the cycle C. Thus we can deï¬ne 2 gdiï¬€erent entropies when âˆ‚M1=âˆ‚M2
 is a genus gRiemann surface. We would also like to stress that the genus o ne version of the
 above calculation is equivalent to the ordinary Euclidean c omputation of the Bekenstein-
 as discussed in [ 40]. Here we are assuming that each of perturbatively stable as ymptotically AdS solutions
 should have its dual CFT interpretation before summing over the geometries.

 Hawking entropy of black holes.
 In the above discussion, we have concentrated on Euclidean w ormholes. In the Lorentzian
 case, the topological censorship [ 58] (with assumptions about energy conditions) guarantees
 that disconnected boundaries are separated from each other by event horizons. This is a
 simple consequence of null geodesic convergence following from Raychaudhuriâ€™s equation;
 essentially if two disconnected boundaries were in causal c ommunication then null geodesics
 which are initially contracting will have to re-expand, vio lating the null convergence condi-
 tion. If we allow the presence of some exotic matter so that th e Lorentzian wormholes exist,
 the above computation of the entanglement entropy in wormho le geometries can be equally
 applied to the Lorentzian case.

 bubble of nothing shrinks from inï¬nite size to a minimum valu er2
 +(7.4) and subsequently
 re-expands out as the time evolves from Ï„=âˆ’âˆžtoÏ„=âˆž. If we consider a double Wick
 51rotation of the (planar) Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in Po incarÂ´ e coordinates, we obtain the
 static AdS bubble (or AdS soliton), whose entanglement entr opy was computed in [ 3] and a
 quantitative comparison with the dual Yang-Mills has been m ade successfully.
 The coordinate Ï‡in (7.3) is compactiï¬ed and the smoothness of this solution require s

 One can show that this solution is asymptotically AdS as râ†’ âˆž. The important point

 The boundary of the metric ( 7.3) is dS 3Ã—S1

 Now we are interested in the entanglement entropy SAat ï¬xed time t=t0in the boundary
 theory on dS 3Ã—S1

 the subsystem Asuch that its boundary âˆ‚AisT2=S1

 deï¬ned by g(Ï„, Ï‡, r ) = 0 times the S1. To explicitly determine the function g, one needs to
 solve a complicated set of partial diï¬€erential equations.
 If we assume24r0â‰ª1 (i.e., âˆ†Ï‡âˆ¼2Ï€ r0â‰ª1), then the condition t= constant is
 approximated by Ï„= constant. To avoid solving the diï¬€erential equations, we c onsider a
 minimal surface on the time slice deï¬ned by t= const .as a further approximation.25Under
 this approximation we can easily ï¬nd the entanglement entro py:

 Note that the ï¬nite term has a minus sign. This is because the e mergence of the bubble
 means the disappearance of degrees of freedom as discussed i n [3] about the static AdS
 bubble example. It would be interesting to understand this t ime-dependent entanglement
 entropy from the dual ï¬eld theory side and to ï¬nd the explicit extremal surface for this
 geometry.
 24Recall that we are working in units where the AdS radius is set to unity.
 25Clearly this surface does not coincide with Yin our covariant construction except Ï„=t= 0. However,
 we believe that we can obtain a qualitative behaviour of the t ime-dependent entanglement entropy using
 this approximation.
 528 Discussion
 In this paper, we have presented the covariant holographic f ormula ( 3.15) (or equivalently
 (3.7)) of the entanglement entropy (or von-Neumann entropy) in A dS/CFT correspondence
 within the supergravity approximation. We propose that it i s simply given by the area of
 the extremal surface in a given asymptotically AdS backgrou nd. This allows us to calculate
 entanglement entropy of dual (conformal) ï¬eld theories eve n in time-dependent backgrounds.
 This is a natural generalization of the previously proposed holographic formula for static AdS
 backgrounds [ 10,24].
 Our covariant holographic proposal claims that the entangl ement entropy SAfor the
 subsystem Ais equal to the area of a certain bulk surface S, which is anchored at the
 boundary âˆ‚A, in Planck units as in the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Our m ain conclusion
 is that the surface Sis given by the extremal surface W, which is an extremum of the area
 functional. We argued that Wis equivalent to the surface Y, which we motivated from the
 covariant entropy bound. In particular, Yis deï¬ned to be the minimal area surface among
 the family of co-dimension two bulk surfaces satisfying the requisite boundary conditions
 with the additional constraint that they support two light- sheets i.e., the null geodesic con-
 gruences directed toward the boundary have non-positive ex pansion. More constructively,
 Ycorresponds to the surface with vanishing null expansions. We gave an argument which
 supports our claim W=Y; a rigorous proof is left as an intriguing problem for the fut ure.
 We also pointed out another potential candidate for a covari antly deï¬ned surface, a minimal
 surface on a maximal time-slice, X, which reduces to the minimal surface in static space-
 times. We showed that Xcoincides with Wwhen the bulk spacetime is foliated by totally
 geodesic spacelike surfaces and argued that generically Xdoesnâ€™t capture the holographic
 entanglement entropy of a speciï¬ed boundary region.
 We argued that our covariant proposal can be derived natural ly using the light-sheet
 construction and thus is closely related to the covariant en tropy bound (Bousso bound) [ 35].
 At ï¬rst sight, this relation is rather surprising, since the entropy bound is usually associated
 with the thermodynamic entropy while the entanglement entr opy has a diï¬€erent origin. It
 strongly supports the historical idea that the entanglemen t entropy is connected with a
 microscopic origin of the gravitational entropy with quant um corrections [ 22,23] (see also
 [20,28] and references therein). We leave further exploration of t his relation as an important
 open problem. It would also be interesting to generalize the covariant holographic formula
 beyond the supergravity approximation assumed in the above discussion (see [ 27] for recent
 progress in the Euclidean case).
 We believe that deeper understanding of the entanglement en tropy will provide crucial
 insights into the nature of the holographic relation betwee n quantum gravity and its dual
 non-gravitational lower dimensional theory. One reason fo r this stems from the universality
 of the deï¬nition of this quantity for any system described by the laws of quantum mechanics.
 53We can deal equally well with diverse systems such as spin cha ins, quantum Hall liquids,
 gauge theories, matrix models, and even cosmological model s from this viewpoint. For each,
 we can then examine if a holographic dual exists, and then exp loit the covariant construction
 above to compute the entanglement entropy. The second reaso n is that the entanglement
 entropy is holographically described by a basic geometrica l quantity, namely the area of
 a well-deï¬ned co-dimension two surface, as we have discusse d extensively. Given a speciï¬c
 bulk geometry, which is described by some particular CFT sta te, we can calculate the proper
 areas of the requisite surfaces which we have conjectured to correspond to the entanglement
 entropy for that state.
 Conversely, given a speciï¬c state of the boundary theory, we can ask how much infor-
 mation is encoded in the entanglement entropy. In particula r, for a system in a given state
 admitting a gravitational dual, if we know the entanglement entropy for all subsystems A
 of the boundary, can we decode the full geometry of the gravit ational dual corresponding
 to that state, at least at the supergravity level? Even thoug h we leave the actual metric
 extraction for future work, we believe that most, if not all, of the metric information can
 indeed be extracted from the entanglement entropy data by a s uitable inversion technique.
 An analogous problem has been discussed in [ 52], where the singularities in the CFT cor-
 relators, the so-called bulk-cone singularities, were use d to distinguish diï¬€erent geometries.
 The basic idea is that the bulk-cone singularities occur for correlators whose operator inser-
 tions are connected by a null geodesic through the bulk space time; and since bulk geodesics
 are determined by the bulk geometry, knowing the endpoints o f null geodesics allows us to
 extract a large amount of information about the bulk geometr y. Using this technique, [ 61]
 has numerically demonstrated metric extraction for a class of static, spherically symmetric
 bulk spacetimes.
 However, null geodesics have their limitations. They are in sensitive to conformal rescaling
 of the metric, and they probe only the part of the bulk which al lows their endpoints to remain
 pinned at the boundary. Hence the metric extraction of [ 61] does not probe the bulk past null
 circular orbits. In this respect, a spacelike geodesic, or m ore generally a spacelike surface,
 would bypass both of these shortcomings. Not only are spacel ike geodesics sensitive to the
 conformal factor, but also they probe deeper into the bulk wh ile remaining pinned at the
 boundary. This is demonstrated in Fig. 4, where metric extraction would be allowed all
 the way down to the horizon. Moreover, when the bulk is 4 or hig her dimensional, the
 co-dimension two surfaces are likewise higher-dimensiona l, and therefore may be expected
 to contain a larger amount of information than geodesics whi ch are only one-dimensional
 quantities.
 The computation of the entanglement entropy in a time-depen dent background is in
 general a very hard question due to technical complications . However, our holographic for-
 mula allows us to solve this problem simply, provided the sys tem under consideration has
 a holographic dual. In this paper, we examined several examp les of time-dependent back-
 54grounds. First we considered the 3-dimensional AdS-Vaidya background, which is dual to a
 time-dependent background of a 2-dimensional CFT. There we found that the entanglement
 entropy computed holographically increases under time evo lution. We have also seen that
 this is closely related to the second law of the black hole the rmodynamics. This result sug-
 gests the expected monotonicity property; namely that give n the null energy condition, in
 any gravitational collapse the entanglement entropy alway s increases. It would be interesting
 to see if monotonicity is preserved once we take into account quantum corrections described
 by the Hawking radiation on the gravity side.
 Another example we discussed concerns wormholes in AdS. Eve n though the two dual
 CFTs on the two disconnected boundaries look decoupled from each other, there are non-
 vanishing correlation functions from the bulk gravity view point [ 40]. We proposed a possible
 resolution to this puzzle by showing that the entanglement e ntropy between the two CFTs
 is actually non-vanishing. This conï¬rms that they are quant um mechanically entangled.
 Since the concept of entanglement entropy is well-deï¬ned in any time-dependent system,
 it provides a very useful physical quantity to analyze in a qu antum system which is far
 from the equilibrium, where we cannot deï¬ne the usual thermo dynamical quantities. At the
 same time, it is an important quantity bearing on quantum pha se transitions of various low
 dimensional systems at zero temperature. Therefore our res ults can be regarded as a ï¬rst
 step toward the analysis of condensed matter physics using t he AdS/CFT correspondence
 (seee.g., [62] for other recent interesting approach).

 A Covariant construction of causally-motivated surface Z
 Above we have discussed three distinct constructions as can didate covariant duals of the
 entanglement entropy, namely the surfaces W,X, and Y. All of these require solving an
 extremization problem. However, in Â§2.4we have also mentioned an alternate construction,
 Z, which may be computationally simpler to ï¬nd. This is becaus e the requisite co-dimension
 one surface on which we deï¬ne Zis constructed purely based on causal relations and therefo re
 55does not require e.g.solving for geodesics (though in practice, in many examples it is quite
 easy to ï¬nd this by using null geodesics).
 The causal covariant construction Zwill be achieved by a series of steps:
 1. Starting with the spatial region AtâŠ‚âˆ‚Ntâˆˆâˆ‚M, construct its domain of dependence
 DtâŠ‚âˆ‚M. This is the set of all boundary points qthrough which all causal boundary
 curves Î³qnecessarily intersect At,
 Dt={qâˆˆâˆ‚M | âˆ€ Î³qâˆˆâˆ‚M,{Î³qâˆ©At} âˆ\e}atio\slash=âˆ…} (A.1)
 2. Construct the bulk â€œcausal wedgeâ€ Ctof the boundary region Dt. This is deï¬ned as the
 set of bulk points pfrom which there exists both a future-directed and a past-di rected
 causal curve, Î³+
 pandÎ³âˆ’
 p, which intersects26Dt.
 Ct={pâˆˆ M | âˆƒ Î³+
 p,{Î³+
 pâˆ©Dt} âˆ\e}atio\slash=âˆ…andâˆƒÎ³âˆ’
 p,{Î³âˆ’
 pâˆ©Dt} âˆ\e}atio\slash=âˆ…} (A.2)
 3. Let Btbe the boundary (in the bulk) of Ct. In some simple cases, this is constructed
 from the future and past bulk light-cones from the past and fu ture tip of Dt.
 Bt={pâˆˆ M\ âˆ‚M âˆ© pâˆˆâˆ‚Ct}=âˆ‚Ct\Dt (A.3)
 4. Finally, consider the set of all spacelike surfaces lying inBtand pinned at âˆ‚At. Â¿From
 these spacelike surfaces, take one with the maximal area.27We denote this maximal
 surface by Zt. So we have ZtâˆˆBtâˆˆ M, âˆ‚Zt=âˆ‚At.
 In Fig. 11we indicate the construction of Zmore explicitly by sketching various 2-
 dimensional slices of the spacetime, as labeled. In Table 1we show the dimensionality
 of the various regions discussed and specify whether they li e in the bulk or in the bound-
 ary. Recall that the Ztis a co-dimension two surface in M, as is the boundary region At.
 Furthermore, this construction does not depend on a choice o f coordinates, but only on phys-
 ically meaningful quantities: causal relations in the spac etime and proper â€œareaâ€ of a given
 spacelike surface. This ensures that we can apply the same co nstruction for time dependent
 bulk geometries just as easily.
 26For purposes of this deï¬nition we treat âˆ‚Mas a subset of M, so that a bulk curve can â€œintersectâ€ ( i.e.,
 terminate on) the boundary. This is motivated by using the us ual â€œcut-oï¬€â€ surface instead of the actual
 boundary. More technically, we want the ideal points associ ated with the TIP or TIF of the requisite curve
 through pto lie in Dt.
 27There may in general be more than one such surface, but we are u ltimately interested in the area of such
 a surface, and this value is unique. The fact that the area is b ounded from above is tied to the fact that
 we are looking for a surface which has only one dimension less thanBt; lower dimensional surfaces could
 achieve arbitrarily high area by â€œcrumplingâ€.

 57A.1 Discrepancy in AdS d+1fordâ‰¥3
 Now let us consider whether the construction Zprovides a viable candidate for the dual
 of the entanglement entropy. In order for the area of Zto be equal to the entanglement
 entropy for general states, a minimal requirement is that Zreduces to the correct minimal
 surface for static spacetimes. Therefore we wish to check wh ether in any static spacetime,
 Zcoincides with W(which, as we argued above, automatically coincides with XandYfor
 all static spacetimes).
 We can ï¬nd an easy counter-example, even for pure AdS, in more than three dimensions
 for non-spherical regions. For simplicity, let us consider the inï¬nite strip in AdS 4, in PoincarÂ´ e
 coordinates. The bulk metric is ds2=1
 z2(âˆ’dt2+dz2+dx2+dy2), and let the region Aon
 the boundary be an inï¬nite strip extended along the ydirection; {t= 0, xâˆˆ(âˆ’h, h)}. The
 minimal surface is given by ( 5.18), with x(z) given by Ëœd= 2 and smeared over all y. On
 the other hand, the causal construction of Zoutlined above is determined by past/future
 directed null geodesics at constant y, from {z= 0, x= 0, t=Â±h}into the bulk. Since
 these are insensitive to the conformal factor of the bulk met ric, they behave just as in ï¬‚at
 spacetime; the maximal area surface, lying on the intersect ion of the future and past light-
 cones from the tips of D0, is given simply by the half-circle z2+x2=h2, uniformly smeared in
 they-direction. We can easily check that this surface Zdoesnotcoincide with the minimal

 surface WsinceZdoes not satisfy28(5.18). In particular, Fig. 12demonstrates the diï¬€erence
 28Note however that, remarkably, for a circular region A, the two surfaces ZandWwould coincide
 58between the two surfaces. Moreover, we can easily check that the area of Zis much larger
 than the area of W(since Zlies closer to the boundary where the warp factor diverges), so
 the former cannot yield the entanglement entropy.
 The above discrepancy gets exacerbated in higher dimension s, where as dincreases, the
 solution to ( 5.18) becomes more separated from the curve Z, given by z2+x2=h2, which is
 independent of d. In fact, in the more physically interesting case of AdS 5, we have an inï¬nite
 discrepancy between the area of Zand that of W. Here, we can actually compare our results
 directly with a free Yang-Mills calculation, and check expl icitly which surface yields a better
 estimate of the entanglement entropy. In particular, the en tropy density corresponding to
 W, which coincides with the minimal surface considered in [ 10] (see Eq.(7.6) of that paper),
 is given by

 where z=Îµis the usual UV cut-oï¬€. Note that we are quoting here the resul t for the entropy
 density and the AdS radius is set to unity. On the other hand, t he entropy density associated
 withZcan be easily computed to be

 Note that apart from the standard 1 /Îµ2divergence, SZalso suï¬€ers from a logarithmic diver-
 gence (related to the conformal anomaly), so that the discre pancy in the areas of ZandW
 is actually inï¬nite, though the leading divergence is the sa me.
 Now, to compare these gravity results with the Yang-Mills re sults, we consider the direct
 free Yang-Mills computation. This leads to the following en tropy density when we expressed
 it in terms of AdS quantities [ 10]:

 Of course, we do not expect the free Yang-Mills result to agre e quantitatively with the AdS
 gravity computation, since the latter corresponds to the st rongly coupled gauge theory. Also
 we cannot directly compare the divergent term since the UV cu toï¬€ in Yang-Mills calculation
 is not necessarily equal to the one in the AdS side. However, w e do expect that the ï¬nite
 part of entropy should agree with each other semi-quantitat ively as evidenced by the famous
 4/3 entropy factor for the black D3-branes.29Comparing ( A.6) with ( A.4) and ( A.5), we
 immediately see that the extremal surface Wyields a much better approximation of the
 entanglement entropy for the free Yang-Mills system than Z. We expect this to remain true
 even at strong coupling.
 exactly.
 29In fact, itâ€™s amusing to note that the ratio of the coeï¬ƒcients of the leading ï¬nite terms in the entangle-
 ment entropy expressions ( A.6) and ( A.4) also lies very close to 4 /3.
 59A.2 3-Dimensional static bulk geometries
 Above we have seen that for AdS d+1withdâ‰¥3, the surface Zdoes not necessarily coincide
 with the requisite minimal surface for static spacetimes. T hisa priori rules it out as a candi-
 date covariant dual of entanglement entropy in time-depend ent scenarios as well. However,
 we may still ask whether in 3 dimensions the Zconstruction works better. After all, the
 dual ï¬eld theory lives in 2 dimensions, so we would expect man y special properties. Indeed,
 from the geometrical point of view, 3-dimensional bulk is sp ecial: since Ais 1-dimensional,
 Btis always described simply by a light-cone. Moreover, perfo rming the above check for
 d= 2, we ï¬nd that Z=W, since the surface z2+x2=h2satisï¬es ( 5.18).
 In fact, slightly less trivially, we can likewise check by ex plicit calculation that in global
 AdS 3, with ds2=âˆ’(r2+ 1)dt2+dr2

 r2(Ï•) =cos2Ï†0

 Similarly, in BTZ, with ds2=âˆ’(r2âˆ’r2

 and are given by

 +cosh2(r+Ï†0)
 sinh2(r+Ï†0) cosh2(r+Ï•)âˆ’cosh2(r+Ï†0) sinh2(r+Ï•). (A.8)
 Let us therefore ask whether this agreement holds in general . Speciï¬cally, consider a
 metric for a general static, spherically symmetric 3-dimen sional spacetime,
 ds2=âˆ’f(r)dt2+h(r)dr2+r2dÏ•2(A.9)
 which we take to be asymptotically AdS ( f(r)â†’r2andh(r)â†’1/r2asrâ†’ âˆž). Let the
 boundary region Abe the same as above, A={t= 0, Ï•âˆˆ(âˆ’Ï†0, Ï†0)}. We want to ask
 whether ZandWcoincide in this general static case. Note that Wis simply a spacelike
 geodesic anchored at Ï•=Â±Ï†0, whereas Zis the projection to t= 0 of a null geodesic
 congruence from the tip of D0.
 The eï¬€ective potential for geodesics with energy Eand angular momentum L, deï¬ned
 by Ë™r2+Veï¬€(r) = 0, is given by
 Veï¬€(r) =1
 h(r)/bracketleftbigg
 âˆ’Îºâˆ’E2
 f(r)+L2
 r2/bracketrightbigg
 (A.10)
 where Îº= 0 for null geodesics and Îº= 1 for spacelike geodesics. Since Wcorresponds to
 the spacelike geodesic at constant t, pinned at Ï•=Â±Ï†0, we have Îº= 1,E= 0, which ï¬xes
 the relation between LandÏ†0. Also, the minimum radius reached rminis easy to ï¬nd from
 Veï¬€(rmin) = 0; we simply have rmin=L. Expressing WasÏ•(r), we then obtain
 Ï•(Â¯r) =Â±L/integraldisplayÂ¯r

 h(r)

 60To construct Z, we consider a null geodesic congruence labeled by â„“â‰¡L/E(and we choose
 parameterization such that E= 1). Then tandÏ•along the â„“geodesic, written in terms of
 r, are given by

 Now, let r0(â„“) be the value of ralong the â„“geodesic at which tâ„“reaches zero, tâ„“(r0(â„“)) = 0.
 ThenZis given by Ï•â„“(r0(â„“)), which as written is a parametric curve parameterized by â„“,
 but out of which â„“should be eliminated to compare directly with A.11.
 To make progress, consider the change in Ï•â„“as we vary r0(i.e., as we vary â„“):
 Î´Ï•â„“(r0(â„“))
 Î´r0(â„“)=âˆ‚Ï•â„“(r0(â„“))

 which we can ï¬nd using the generalized Leibnitz rule. We want to compare the resulting
 expression with the corresponding variation for the spacel ike geodesic W,
 dÏ•(r)

 r/radicalbigg
 h(r)
 r2âˆ’L2atr=r0(â„“). (A.15)
 We then obtain a long integral equation, which we can simplif y (eliminate the integral) by
 observing that âˆ‚â„“tâ„“(r0(â„“)) = 0, which follows from the deï¬nition of r0(â„“); we can again use
 the generalized Leibnitz rule to write this explicitly.
 Hence the assumption that Z=Wreduces to the much simpler equation, which we wish
 to verify/falsify for general f(r), and for all â„“:
 r2
 0(â„“)âˆ’â„“2f(r0(â„“)) =L2. (A.16)
 While it is straightforward to check that this mysterious re lation does hold for the cases
 discussed above of AdS and BTZ, as consistency demands, it is less trivial to check it for
 general f(r). Resorting to numerical analysis, we ï¬nd that unfortunate ly (A.16) is not
 satisï¬ed for arbitrary f(r) (although Zis typically well-approximated by W). Hence we
 conclude that even in 3 dimensions, Z âˆ\e}atio\slash=W.
 To understand better why this is the case, consider the parti cular point on the surfaces Z
 andWcorresponding to Ï•= 0, namely when rreaches its minimal value. For the spacelike
 geodesic W, this is simply L; whereas for Z, it corresponds to r0(â„“= 0)â‰¡r0. Therefore
 a simple way to check that Z âˆ\e}atio\slash=Wis to show that in general r0âˆ\e}atio\slash=L. We can extract the
 relation between r0andLby writing Ï†0using the spacelike geodesic ( A.11) and the null
 geodesic ( A.12) with â„“= 0:

 61But this relation clearly indicates that whereas for any ï¬xe dÏ†0,Ldepends only on h(r)
 (since the spacelike geodesic at constant tcannot be sensitive to f(r)),r0depends on both
 h(r) and f(r) â€“ so r0cannot coincide with Lfor arbitrary f(r). This provides a proof that
 Z âˆ\e}atio\slash=Wfor general 3-dimensional static spherically symmetric sp acetimes.
 A.3 Use of Zto bound the entanglement entropy
 Above, we have described the construction Zand argued that it does not in general coincide
 withX,Y, orW, even in static backgrounds. Hence, although Zis based only on causal
 relations and therefore carries a certain appeal due to its s implicity, we may well ask what
 is it useful for.
 In the context of entanglement entropy, we propose that comp utingZis useful (if simpler
 than computing W,Y, orX) because it provides a bound on the entanglement entropy. In
 particular, we expect that the area of Zis larger than (or equal to) the areas of WandY,
 at least for â€œsensibleâ€ spacetimes. If the spacetime is stat ic, this is clearly true by deï¬nition
 because the correct surface W=Yis the minimal area surface. In more general case,
 one (3.7) of our covariant constructions, implies this speculation , though we cannot oï¬€er a
 general proof.
 Imagine the situation where we want to ï¬nd the minimal surfac eW=Yfor a complicated
 choice of the subsystem Ain order to compute the holographic entanglement entropy in a
 static higher dimensional spacetime. In this case, it seems almost impossible to ï¬nd the
 minimal surface analytically because we need to solve a part ial diï¬€erential equation with
 a generic initial condition. However, to ï¬nd null geodesics will be much more tractable.
 Then we can ï¬nd a deï¬nite and useful bound for the entanglemen t entropy by employing
 the construction of Z.
 B Null expansions and extremal surfaces
 B.1 Deï¬nition of extrinsic curvature
 Consider a d-dimensional spacelike submanifold Sin aD-dimensional spacetime Mwith
 Lorentzian signature. The coordinates of Mare denoted by xÂµand those of the submanifold
 SareÎ¾Î±.
 We deï¬ne the extrinsic curvature K(m)
 ÂµÎ½as follows. There are Dâˆ’dvectors n(m)
 Âµ(m=
 1,2, ..., D âˆ’d) onSwhich are orthogonal to S. The extrinsic curvature is deï¬ned by
 âˆ‡Âµn(m)
 Î½=K(m)
 ÂµÎ½. (B.1)
 62In particular, if we choose a coordinate system adapted to Sso that xÂµ= (Î¾Î±, yl), where
 l= 1,2, ..., D âˆ’dlabels the directions normal to S, then we obtain
 K(m)
 Î±Î²=âˆ’Î“l
 Î±Î²n(m)
 l. (B.2)
 Picking any two tangent vectors uÂµ, vÂµâˆˆTS, we can equivalently deï¬ne the extrinsic cur-
 vature by
 K(m)
 ÂµÎ½uÂµvÎ½= (uÂµâˆ‡ÂµvÎ½)n(m)
 Î½. (B.3)
 B.2 Extremal surfaces
 We deï¬ne an extremal surface by the saddle point of the area fu nctional
 Area(S) =/integraldisplay
 S(dÎ¾)d/radicalbig
 detg, (B.4)
 where gÎ±Î²is the induced metric and is written in terms of the total spac etime metric gÂµÎ½as
 gÎ±Î²=gÂµÎ½âˆ‚XÂµ
 âˆ‚Î¾Î±âˆ‚XÎ½
 âˆ‚Î¾Î².
 After a little algebra, the equation of motion can be rewritt en as
 Î Âµ
 Î±Î²gÎ±Î²= 0, (B.5)
 where Î Âµ
 Î±Î²is deï¬ned by
 Î Âµ
 Î±Î²=âˆ‚Î±âˆ‚Î²XÂµ+ Î“Âµ
 Î½Î»âˆ‚Î±XÎ½âˆ‚Î²XÎ»âˆ’Î“Î³
 Î±Î²âˆ‚Î³XÂµ. (B.6)
 It is possible to show that Î Âµ
 Î±Î²is orthogonal to TSi.e., Î Âµ
 Î±Î²âˆ‚Î³XÂµ= 0. Thus the only
 independent components are Dâˆ’dvectors n(m)
 ÂµÎ Âµ
 Î±Î².
 Let us choose the speciï¬c coordinate system such that XÂµ= (Î¾Î±, yl) as before. Then it
 is easy to see
 n(m)
 ÂµÎ Âµ
 Î±Î²= Î“l
 Î±Î²n(m)
 l=âˆ’K(m)
 Î±Î². (B.7)
 Thus we ï¬nd that the extremal surface condition is equivalen t to the vanishing of the trace
 of the extrinsic curvature
 âˆ’gÎ±Î²K(m)
 Î±Î²=gÎ±Î²n(m)
 ÂµÎ Âµ
 Î±Î²= 0. (B.8)
 In a generic coordinate frame, this is expressed as
 gÂµÎ½K(m)
 ÂµÎ½= 0. (B.9)
 63B.3 Expansions of null geodesics: relation to extremal surf aces
 Consider a co-dimension two spacelike surface S. There are two independent normal vectors
 at each point on S. We can choose them to be lightlike and call them NÂµ
 +andNÂµ
 âˆ’. They are
 normalized such that NÂµ
 +N+Âµ=NÂµ
 âˆ’Nâˆ’Âµ= 0 and NÂµ
 +Nâˆ’Âµ=âˆ’1. We can deï¬ne the extrinsic
 curvatures K(Â±)
 ÂµÎ½for these vectors.
 The two null expansions Î¸Â±are deï¬ned by
 Î¸Â±=gÂµÎ½K(Â±)
 ÂµÎ½. (B.10)
 It is clear from the above deï¬nition of the extrinsic curvatu re that when gÂµÎ½K(Â±)
 ÂµÎ½= 0 (i.e.,
 Sis a extremal surface), both of the expansions are zero Î¸Â±= 0.
 Also from this deï¬nition we can ï¬nd that when NÂµis a null Killing vector, i.e.,âˆ‡ÂµNÎ½+
 âˆ‡Î½NÂµ= 0, the null expansion Î¸is obviously vanishing.
 C Details of perturbative analysis in Vaidya-AdS backgroun d
 We perform a perturbative analysis by only keeping the linea r order about the mass m(v)
 in the Vaidya.
 We consider the extremal surface (or equivalently a geodesi c) in the background ( 6.3)
 assuming that m(v) is very small. At the boundary r=râˆžâ†’ âˆž, the two end points of the
 geodesic are given by ( v, r, x) = (v0, râˆž,Â±h). We assume the following proï¬le
 r(x) =1âˆš
 h2âˆ’x2+s(x),
 v(x) =v0âˆ’âˆš
 h2âˆ’x2+u(x),(âˆ’hâ‰¤xâ‰¤h). (C.1)
 After we plug this into ( 6.10) and ( 6.11), we obtain the diï¬€erential equations for the
 perturbation s(x) and u(x) at linear order:
 2x(h2âˆ’x2)3/2sâ€²(x)âˆ’2âˆš
 h2âˆ’x2(2x2+h2)s(x) +x2(h2âˆ’x2)m[v(x)] + 2Ç«h= 0,
 (C.2)
 (h2âˆ’4x2)s(x) + 2x(h2âˆ’x2)sâ€²(x)âˆ’(h2âˆ’x2)uâ€²â€²(x) = 0 , (C.3)
 where, we have deï¬ned the very small quantity Ç«by
 h=1
 râˆ—+Ç« . (C.4)
 (Recall that h=1
 râˆ—ifm= 0.)
 64Integrating ( C.2), we obtain
 s(x) =âˆ’x
 (h2âˆ’x2)3
 2/bracketleftbigg
 âˆ’Ç«h
 x+/integraldisplayx
 0dym[v(y)]
 2(h2âˆ’y2)/bracketrightbigg
 . (C.5)
 Clearly we ï¬nd s(0) =Ç«
 h2and this is consistent with ( C.4). Notice also the property s(x) =
 s(âˆ’x). To make sense of our perturbative argument, we need to requ ire that s(x) does not
 include the singular term âˆ¼(hâˆ’x)âˆ’3/2when we take the limit xâ†’h. This determines the
 value of Ç«as follows:30
 Ç«=1
 2/integraldisplayh
 0dy m[v(y)] (h2âˆ’y2). (C.6)
 The other function u(x) can be found by integrating ( C.3) twice by using ( C.5).
 After some analysis we can show that the UV cut-oï¬€ r=râˆžis related to the UV cut-oï¬€

 Explicit Calculations of Geodesic Length: Consider the following speciï¬c approxima-
 tion to the time-dependent mass:
 m(v) =m(v0) +mâ€²(v0)(vâˆ’v0). (C.9)
 This is true when the time-dependence is small and is exact wh en the mass is linear function
 of the time v. Further we assume the mass itself is also very small. Under t hese conditions
 we obtain from ( C.6)
 Ç«=1
 2/integraldisplayh
 0dx(m(v0)âˆ’mâ€²(v0)âˆš
 h2âˆ’x2)(h2âˆ’x2) =h3
 3m(v0)âˆ’3Ï€h4
 32mâ€²(v0). (C.10)
 With the speciï¬c proï¬le ( C.9), we can integrate ( C.5) and ( C.8) analytically. After a
 somewhat lengthy computation we ï¬nd
 L(v0) = log/parenleftbigg2h
 Î´/parenrightbigg
 +2
 3h2m(v0)âˆ’5Ï€
 32h3mâ€²(v0). (C.11)
 Substituting the relation ( C.7) into ( C.11), we obtain the ï¬nal expression
 L(v0) = 2 log(2 hrâˆž) +1
 3h2m(v0)âˆ’Ï€
 16h3mâ€²(v0). (C.12)
 30When mis a constant this leads to Ç«=m
 3h2, which is consistent with our previous analysis in the BTZ
 geometry.
 65The ï¬nite part of the geodesic length after we subtract the un iversal divergent piece 2 log(2 h râˆž)
 is now given by
 Lreg=1
 3h2m(v0)âˆ’Ï€
 16h3mâ€²(v0). (C.13)
 In the case of the linear proï¬le (or when mâ€²â€²(v0) is small enough) we ï¬nd the geodesic length
 at generic time v
 Lreg(v) =1
 3h2[m(v0) +mâ€²(v0)(vâˆ’v0)]âˆ’Ï€
 16h3mâ€²(v0)
 â‰ƒm(vâˆ’3Ï€h/16), (C.14)
 and its time derivative is given by
 d
 dvLreg(v) =1
 3h2mâ€²(v). (C.15)
 Explicit form of s(x)andu(x):Under the assumption ( C.9), we can ï¬nd the following
 explicit solutions for the functions s(x) and u(x) introduced in ( C.1):
 s(x) = s2h2âˆ’x2
