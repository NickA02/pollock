 ABSTRACT
 Context. The ï¬rst unidentiï¬ed very high energy gamma ray source (TeV J 2032+4130) in the Cygnus region has been the subject of
 intensive searchfor a counterpart source at other waveleng ths. In particular,observations inradio andX-rays are imp ortant totrace a
 population of non-thermal electrons.
 Aims.A deep (â‰ˆ50 ksec) exposure of TeV J2032 +4130 with XMM-Newton has been obtained. The large collection area and the
 ï¬eld of view of the X-ray telescopes on-board of XMM-Newton allow to search for faint extended X-ray emission possibly l inked to
 TeVJ2032+4130.
 Methods. The contribution of point sources to the observed X-ray emis sion from TeV J2032 +4130 is subtracted from the data. The
 point-source subtracted X-ray data are analyzed using blan k sky exposures and regions adjacent to the position of TeV J2 032+4130
 inthe ï¬eldof view covered by the XMM-Newton telescopes tose arch for diï¬€use X-rayemission.
 Results. An extended X-ray emission region with a full width half maxi mum (FWHM) size of â‰ˆ12 arc min is found. The centroid
 of the emission is co-located with the position of TeV J2032 +4130. The angular extension of the X-ray emission region is s lightly
 smallerthantheangular sizeofTeVJ2032 +4130 (FWHM=14Â±3arcmin).Theenergyspectrumoftheemissioncoincidingwi ththe

 than the summed contribution of the point sources present. T he energy spectrum can also be ï¬t with a thermal emission mode l from
 anionized plasma witha temperature kBTâ‰ˆ10 keV.
 Conclusions. We conclude that the faint extended X-ray emission discover ed in this observation is the X-ray counterpart of
 TeV J2032+4130. Formally, it can not be excluded that the extended emis sion is due to an unrelated population of faint, hot
 (kBTâ‰ˆ10 keV) unresolved point-sources which by chance coincides with the position and extension of TeV J2032 +4130. We
 discuss our ï¬ndings inthe frame of bothhadronic andleptoni c gamma-rayproduction scenarios.
 1. Introduction
 GroundbasedairCherenkovtelescopeshavedetectedinthel ast
 6 years a number of unidentiï¬ed sources of very high energy
 (VHE,E>100GeV)gamma-rayslocatedintheGalacticplane.
 Theï¬rst representativeof these sources(TeV J2032 +4130)was
 discovered serendipitously with the HEGRA telescope syste m
 in the Cygnus region (Rowell& Horns, 2002; Aharonianet al.,
 2002).
 In a subsequent deep exposure for a total of â‰ˆ280 hours
 of observation time the source detection was conï¬rmed and
 its properties were studied in detail (Horns&Rowell, 2004;
 Aharonianet al.,2005a).
 A remarkable feature of TeV J2032 +4130 is the fact that
 the angular extension of the source is (6 .2Â±1.2statÂ±0.9sys)
 arc min in radius which corresponds to a FWHM =14 arc min.
 Gamma-ray emission from TeV J2032 +4130 has been con-
 ï¬rmedindependentlybythe Whipplecollaboration(Langet a l.,
 2004; Konopelkoetal., 2006). A gamma-ray excess from the

 ence mission with instruments and contributions directly f unded by
 ESAMember StatesandNASA.Cygnus region albeit more extended was recently reported by
 the Milagro collaboration(Abdoet al., 2006). The properti esof
 TeV J2032+4130 are common to most of the other unidenti-
 ï¬ed VHE gamma-ray sources that have been discovered with
 the H.E.S.S. telescopes so far (Aharonianetal., 2005b, 200 6a):
 TeV J2032+4130 can be considered as the proto-type of the
 unidentiï¬edVHE gamma-raysourcesknowntoday.
 So far, a number of point-like or moderately extended candi-
 dates for counterparts of TeV J2032 +4130 have been identi-
 ï¬edat radio(Paredeset al.,2006; Buttet al.,2006b)andX-r ays
 (Buttet al.,2003, 2006a; Mukherjeeet al., 2003,2006).
 The origin and nature of TeV J2032 +4130 remains unclear. It
 has been suggested that the nearby ( d=1.7 kpc) massive
 stellar OB association Cyg OB2 (see e.g. KnÂ¨ odlseder (2000) )
 could be an accelerator of charged cosmic rays and conse-
 quentlyasite ofgamma-rayproduction(Aharonianet al.,20 02;
 Butt etal., 2006a; Aharonianet al., 2006b). This scenario h as
 been strengthenedby the recently discoveredspatially ext ended
 VHEgamma-rayemissionfromthedirectionoftheopenstella r
 clusterWesterlund2(Aharonianet al., 2007).
 Other possible explanations for the nature of TeV J2032 +4130
 have been brought forward including gamma-ray production i n2 Horns et al.:XMM-Newton observation of TeVJ2032 +4130
 possible jet lobes of Cyg X-3 (Aharonianet al., 2002), an un-
 known pulsar wind nebula (Bednarek, 2003), or even extra-
 galactic source candidates as suggested by Mukherjeeet al.
 (2003)andButtet al. (2006b).
 Independent of the nature of the source, two di ï¬€erent gamma-
 ray production mechanisms are generally considered. In the
 hadronic scenario , gamma-rays are produced mainly via in-
 elastic scattering of accelerated nuclei with the ambient
 medium(seee.g.Aharonianet al.(2005a);Reimeretal.(200 6);
 Domingo-SantamarÂ´ Ä±a&Torres (2006)). Alternatively, in t he
 leptonicscenariogamma-raysareproducedviainverseCompton
 scattering of ambient photons from a population of ener-
 getic electrons (Aharonianet al., 2005a; Reimeret al., 200 6).
 Recently, it has been suggested, that excitation of giant di pole
 resonances of relativistic heavy nuclei in radiation domin ated
 environmentscouldberesponsibleforgamma-rayproductio nin
 CygOB2 (Anchordoquiet al.,2006).

 2. ObservationsandDataanalyses
 The data were taken during two separate pointings of XMM-
 Newton. Table 1 summarizes the available data and conï¬gura-
 tions of the instruments used. The data were screened for sof t

 the contamination using ray-tracing simulations has shown that
 the contribution of scattered light from Cyg X-3 to the X-ray
 emission seen fromTeV J2032 +4130is negligible.At the same
 time, the vignetting of the telescopes is smallest in this en ergy
 range(Kirsch, 2006;Pradas&Kerp,2005).
 Data reductionandanalyseswereperformedusingtheStanda rd
 XMM-NewtonScienceAnalysisSoftware SASv7.0.
 2.1. Search fordiffuseX-rayemission
 In an initial step of the data analyses, a catalogue of source s
 detected in the 1-5 keV energy range is assembled using the
 edetectchaintasksimultaneouslyfortheMOS1,MOS2,and
 EPIC pn cameras for each of the two exposures. The minimum
 detectionlikelihoodis set to a low valueof 2. This way, 13.5 %
 ofthedetectedsourcesareduetostatisticalï¬‚uctuationsw hileat
 the same time, more and fainter sources are detected than wit h
 thedefaultvalueof10.Adetailedstudyofthepointsources de-
 tected in this XMM-Newtonobservationwill be presented els e-
 where. Here, the source catalogue has been used to generate
 model images of the point sources separately for each camera
 and pointing taking into account the position dependent poi ntspread functionof the XMM-Newtonmirrors.These model im-
 ages are then subtracted o ï¬€the individual frames of the three
 cameras and for the two pointings. Within the 6.2â€²region cov-
 ered by the extension of the TeV source, a total energy ï¬‚ux of
 f1âˆ’5 keVâ‰ˆ10âˆ’12ergs/(cm2s) associated with point sources is
 observed. Inordertosubtracttheparticleandextragalact icpho-
 ton background blank sky event ï¬les for the corresponding ob -
 servation modes and ï¬lter settings have been obtained from t he
 XMM guest observersâ€™facility1. The blankï¬eld data have been
 processed to match the observational data and the resulting im-
 ages are subtracted o ï¬€the pointings towards TeV J2032 +4130.
 TheimagesfortheMOS1andMOS2camerasobtainedfromthe
 two exposures are combined to form a background subtracted
 mosaic. The images of the EPIC pn camera have been omit-
 ted becauseof artefactsresultingfromover-subtractingt he con-
 tribution of point sources. For each of the four remaining im -
 ages, exposure maps have been generated using the SAS task
 eexpmap. The exposure maps are combined in a mosaic which
 isthentrimmedtoaminimumexposureof5kseccorresponding
 to roughly 5 % of the peak value. The background subtracted
 mosaic is then divided by the exposure map to obtain an expo-
 sure corrected, background subtracted, and source free ima ge.
 Fig. 1 shows three images of the combined exposures of the
 MOS1 and MOS2 cameras before the subtraction of the model
 imagesofthepointsources(a),afterthesubtractionandsm ooth-

 segments in the southern part of Fig. 1a. While Fig. 1b shows
 indicationsfor the presenceof a rim-like featureresembli ngthe

 be noted that the subtraction of point-sources has an impact on
 the observed morphology on angular scales small compared to
 the extensionof the detectedextendedemission.Fora compa ri-
 sonwiththeextensionandmorphologyofthegamma-raysourc e
 TeV J2032+4130, contours are overlaid to Fig. 1c. The X-ray
 image shows an extended emission region which is co-located
 with TeV J2032+4130 and of similar extension. The exposure
 corrected image of the di ï¬€use emission is ï¬t by a Gaussian
 with a width of (5 .1Â±0.3) arc min which corresponds to a
 FWHM=(11.7Â±0.6)arcmin2.
 2.2. Energyspectrum of the diffuseX-rayemission
 In order to determine the energy spectrum of the di ï¬€use X-ray
 emission,thecontributionofthepointsourceshastoberem oved
 by excising regions around the sources. We use an excising re -
 gion adapted to the point spread function and brightness of t he
 source. The size of the region is chosen such that the relativ e
 contribution of the source to the local background is less th an
 20 % at the boundary of the excised region. The wings of the
 pointspreadfunctionleadtoacontaminationofthedetecte ddif-
 fuse emissionwhich amountsto 27% ofthe excesssignal seen.
 Thiseï¬€ect ofcontaminationwouldbehowevercompensatedby
 the opposite eï¬€ect caused by the di ï¬€use emission present in the
 excised region (â‰ˆ25 % ) and therefore excluded from the re-
 constructedenergyspectrum.We estimatethesystematicun cer-
 taintyofthiscontaminationtobe 10% ofthetotal ï¬‚ux.Theen -

 In order to estimate the inï¬‚uence of faint, unresolved point
 sources present in the stellar cluster, we have reduced X-ra y
 imaging data taken with the Chandra satellite (Obs.# 4501 fo r
 48.6 ksec on TeV J2032 +4130 and Obs.# 4511 for 98.7 ksec

 CygOB2).BaseduponacomparisonoftheChandraandXMM-

 ulation present in the Cyg OB2 cluster (Colomboetal., 2006) ,
 we estimate that point sources below the XMM-Newton detec-
 tion limit can contribute up to â‰ˆ30 % of the observed di ï¬€use
 emission. It is however not straight-forward to correct the ob-
 served excess for the unresolved point sources detected wit h
 Chandra as the ï¬‚ux of the sources is generally found to vary
 with time. We estimate the systematic uncertainty on the ï¬‚ux
 conservatively to be 50 % combining the inï¬‚uence of the unre-Table 1. Summary of observation times and conï¬gurations on

 The XMM-Newton observations presented here indicate the
 presence of an extended (FWHM =11.7 arc min) X-ray source
 co-located with the ï¬rst unidentiï¬ed VHE gamma-ray source
 TeV J2032+4130 discovered with the HEGRA air Cherenkov
 telescope system. The size of the X-ray source is similar to t he
 one of TeV J2032+4130. The energy spectrum can be ï¬t by a

 an upper limit to the actual radio emission associated with
 TeV J2032+4130. The upper limits between 0.5â€“5 keV (CX,
 Chandra) and 20â€“40 keV (ISGRI, INTEGRAL) are taken from

 thecaptionofFig.2.the X-ray source in the energyrangefrom 2â€“10 keV is a factor
 of 2â€“3 smaller than the one observed from TeV J2032 +4130at
 energiesfrom1â€“10TeV.
 We note that the observed extended X-ray emission could in
 principlebe a so far unknownpopulationof faint X-raysourc es
 that are by chance distributed at an angular size which is sim -
 ilar to the one of TeV J2032 +4130. The energy spectrum of
 these sources would have to be di ï¬€erent from the bulk of the
 stellar X-ray sources detected from Cyg OB2 (Colomboet al.,
 2006) which on average show a thermal spectrum with kBTâ‰ˆ
 1...3 keV. Taking these considerations into account, we con-
 clude that the observed extended X-ray emission is the X-ray
 counterpartofTeVJ2032 +4130.

 ingahadronicgamma-rayproductionscenarioindicatestha tthe

 to energies of a few 100 TeV can provide a good ï¬t to the X-
 ray and gamma-ray data. In contrary to the hadronic scenario ,
 the gamma-ray energy spectrum above 10 TeV is expected to
 be rather soft due to un-avoidableKlein-Nishina suppressi onof
 inverse Compton scattering. Furthermore, the seed photon d en-
 sity has to be higher than the average value in the interstell ar
 medium (which is not unlikely given the possible proximity t o
 the Cyg OB2 stellar association and the large stellar extinc tion
 towards that region indicating high density of dust). In the lep-
 tonic scenario, the X-ray spectrum can be expected to vary at
 diï¬€erent parts of the source due to cooling e ï¬€ects. More X-ray
 observationswill berequiredtodetectspectralvariabili ty.
 Finally, neutrinoobservationswill provedecisive to disc ern be-
 tween the two emission scenarios (since neutrinos are only e x-
 pected in the hadronic scenario). Even though the neutrino ï¬‚ ux
 calculatedhereisverylikelynotdetectablewiththecomin ggen-
 eration of neutrino telescopes like IceCube (Achterberget al.,
 2006), it may be that the gamma-rayï¬‚ux detected with Milagro
 from the same region is tracing the high energy particles whi ch

 this case, the region aroundTeV J2032+4130would be a pow-
 erful high energy neutrino source and would be detectable wi th
 futureneutrinotelescopes(Beacom&Kistler, 2007).
 ItshouldbenotedthattheobservationsofTeVJ2032 +4130car-
 ried out with XMM-Newton are so far the deepest observations
 available for any of the unidentiï¬ed VHE gamma-ray sources.
 It will be interesting to perform similar observations to se arch
