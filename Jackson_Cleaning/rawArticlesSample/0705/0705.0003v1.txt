 days. XO-2 has high metallicity, [Fe/H]=0.45 Â±0.02, high proper motion, Âµtot= 157 mas yrâˆ’1, and has
 a common proper motion stellar companion with 31â€²â€²separation. The two stars are nearly identical
 twins, with very similar spectra and apparent magnitudes. D ue to the high metallicity, these early
 K dwarf stars have a mass and radius close to solar, Mâ‹†= 0.98Â±0.02 M âŠ™andRâ‹†= 0.964Â±0.02

 RâŠ™. The high proper motion of XO-2 results from an eccentric orb it (Galactic pericenter, Rper<4
 kpc) well conï¬ned to the Galactic disk ( Zmaxâˆ¼100 pc). In addition, the phase space position of
 XO-2 is near the Hercules dynamical stream, which points to a n origin of XO-2 in the metal-rich,
 inner Thin Disk and subsequent dynamical scattering into th e solar neighborhood. We describe an
 eï¬ƒcient Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for calculating the Bayesian posterior probability of
 the system parameters from a transit light curve. System par ameters and conï¬dence intervals from a

 1.INTRODUCTION
 We announce the discovery of an extrasolar planet,
 XO-2b, that transits a bright, V=11.2, star. With an or-
 bital period, Pâˆ¼2.6 days, planetary radius, Rp=0.973
 RJ, and planetary mass, Mp=0.57 M J, XO-2b be-
 longs to the growing class of transiting Hot Jupiter
 (HJ) planets (Charbonneau et al. 2007). Despite the
 increasing number of transiting planets known, much
 work still remains to understand the observed prop-
 erties of planets. The transiting planets HD209458b
 (Charbonneau et al. 2000) and HAT-P-1b (Bakos et al.
 2007) have anomalously large radii compared to theoreti-
 cal models and are thought to require an external source
 of energy to remain inï¬‚ated (Bodenheimer et al. 2003;
 Guillot & Showman 2002; Winn & Holman 2005). How-
 ever, recently Burrows et al. (2006) explain the radii of
 transiting planets without the need for an extra source
 of energy by accounting for enhanced metallicity opaci-

 ical radii. In contrast, HD149026b has an extremely
 high density and small radius (Sato et al. 2005). There
 is general agreement that explaining the small radius
 of HD149026b requires a massive central core, Mc=
 70MâŠ•, of heavy refractory elements (Sato et al. 2005;
 Fortney et al. 2006).
 Disentangling the eï¬€ects of stellar irradiation, mi-
 gration, central core mass, and composition on the
 observed properties of planets requires discovering
 more bright transiting planets (Charbonneau et al. 2007;
 Fortney et al. 2006). XO-2b is the second contribution
 to the bright transiting planet sample provided by the
 XO Project (McCullough et al. 2005); XO-1b being the
 ï¬rst (McCullough et al. 2006). Of the bright transiting
 planet hosts ( V <12), XO-2 has the highest metallic-
 ity ([Fe/H]=0.45 see Â§3.1). In addition, from a recent
 catalog of extrasolar planets (Butler et al. 2006), XO-2
 has a higher metallicity than 96% of all known extrasolar
 planet hosts.
 Metallicity plays a crucial role in the formation of plan-
 ets and the resulting HJ atmospheres. The frequency
 of radial velocity detected planets is known to increase
 with metallicity (Fischer & Valenti 2005). In the core
 accretion planet formation model, a high metallicity en-
 vironment grows larger cores and enables more objects
 to reach the critical mass necessary for runaway gas ac-
 cretion and transformation into a detectable gas giant
 planet (Ida & Lin 2004; Benz et al. 2006). Detailed ï¬ts
 to the mass and radius of the known transiting planets
 yields a mass estimate for the central refractory element
 core (Guillot et al. 2006; Burrows et al. 2006). These in-
 vestigations derive a larger core mass for planets that
 transit higher metallicity stars. In addition to the bulk2
 properties of extrasolar planets, metallicity plays an im-
 portant role in the planetâ€™s atmosphere, especially for a
 HJ experiencing large stellar irradiation. An increased
 metallicity results in a greater absorption of the stel-
 lar irradiation and larger equilibrium temperatures than
 a comparable planet of lower metallicity (Fortney et al.
 2006). The variations in equilibrium temperature can
 lead to variations in the dominant observable features in
 the planetâ€™s atmosphere.
 Amongst the other transiting HJ planets, XO-2b
 shares a common characteristic with another transiting
 HJ, HAT-P-1b (Bakos et al. 2007). Both planets orbit
 one member of a nearly-equal-mass, wide separation stel-
 lar binary. The XO-2 stellar binary system has a sepa-
 ration of 31â€²â€²(âˆ¼4600 AU separation with a distance
 ofâˆ¼150 pc) and both components have an identical
 within the uncertainties 157 mas yrâˆ’1proper motion vec-
 tor as measured with Tycho-2 (HÃ¸g et al. 2000) and the
 high proper motion catalog of (LÂ´ epine & Shara 2005).
 It is not unusual for planets to exist in binary systems.
 Raghavan et al. (2006) ï¬nd >23% of stars with planets
 have a stellar companion, however, they ï¬nd evidence
 that the extrasolar planet sample is deï¬cient in stellar bi-
 naries when compared to the ï¬eld. A stellar companion
 with a 4600 AU separation is not expected to inï¬‚uence
 the planet formation process. Even assuming an orbital
 eccentricity, e=0.8, for the unknown eccentricity of the
 XO-2 stellar binary, planets within acâˆ¼170 AU of XO-2
 are dynamically stable (Holman & Wiegert 1999) (we as-
 sume the current measured projected binary separation
 is close to the actual semi-major axis of the orbit when
 calculating ac). Empirically, Desidera & Barbieri (2007)
 do not ï¬nd any statistically signiï¬cant diï¬€erence between
 planets around single stars and planets in wide ( a >100
 AU) separation binaries. However, understanding the
 inï¬‚uence of a stellar companion on the planet formation
 process is complicated by the fact that the binary con-
 ï¬guration during planet formation may be vastly diï¬€er-
 ent than what is currently observed (Marzari & Barbieri
 2007; Malmberg et al. 2007).
 The similar brightness of the XO-2 stellar binary com-
 ponents and their angular separation provides an ex-
 cellent opportunity for detailed line abundance stud-
 ies. The higher metallicity of the known planet host
 stars is thought to be of primordial origin rather
 than heavy element pollution due to infalling planets
 (Fischer & Valenti 2005; Gonzalez 2006). The infalling
 planet model for explaining the higher metallicity of the
 known planet host stars has predominately come from
 observations showing diï¬€ering element abundances be-
 tween common proper motion binary components. These
 element abundance diï¬€erences have typically been over-
 turned by further independent analyses (Gonzalez 2006).
 The diï¬ƒculty in reliable abundance diï¬€erences results
 from systematic eï¬€ects in analyzing stars of diï¬€erent Teff
 and evolutionary state (Schuler et al. 2006). Such eï¬€ects
 are reduced for the XO-2 stellar binary.
 On the sky, XO-2 and a line joining its stellar com-
 panion has a position angle of 162â—¦, which lies nearly di-
 rectly in the North-South direction (see the ï¬nder chart
 in Figure 1). XO-2 is the Northern component of the
 binary (indicated by the arrow in Figure 1). The mag-
 nitude diï¬€erence between the components is âˆ† V= 0.05
 mag. Thus, in the optical, XO-2 is fainter than its South-

 ern companion. The traditional nomenclature for binary
 stars designates XO-2 as XO-2B and the planet XO-2Bb.
 However, throughout this article we simply designate the
 transiting HJ stellar host XO-2 and the planet around
 it XO-2b. When it is unclear from the context we al-
 ternatively designate XO-2 as XO-2N and the Southern
 stellar companion as XO-2S. We adopt this naming con-
 vention because the magnitude diï¬€erence between the
 stellar components is small and the spectra are nearly
 identical, both of which make it diï¬ƒcult to distinguish
 the objects, whereas the 31â€²â€²separation readily distin-
 guishes the stellar components based on declination. We
 refer to both stellar components as a unit as the XO-2
 stellar binary.
 InÂ§2, we provide details of the discovery and follow
 up photometry and spectroscopy. The high resolution
 spectroscopy is analyzed in Â§3.1 to determine the stellar
 properties of XO-2N and XO-2S. The high precision pho-
 tometry is analyzed in Â§3.2 employing a Ï‡2minimization
 approach in addition to an eï¬ƒcient Markov Chain Monte
 Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to determine the properties of
 XO-2b. We conï¬rm the planetary mass of XO-2b with
 radial velocity measurements in Â§3.3. The ephemeris for
 XO-2b is reï¬ned and the transit observations are inves-
 tigated for transit timing variations in Â§3.4. There is
 a brief discussion regarding the XO-2 stellar binary and
 its Galactic orbit in Â§4, and we summarize the article in
 Â§5.
 2.OBSERVATIONS
 2.1.XO Project Photometry
 XO-2b is the second transiting planet discovered by
 the XO survey after XO-1b (McCullough et al. 2006).
 McCullough et al. (2005) and McCullough & Burke
 (2007) describe the instrumentation, operation, and
 analysis in more detail than the summary provided here.
 The twin, 200mm XO cameras power drift scan in dec-
 lination over a 7 deg Ã—62 deg strip every ten minutes on
 clear nights for more than 2 months per season of visi-
 bility. The XO observations employ a broad (0.4 Âµm to
 0.7Âµm) passband. The star XO-2 comes from the XO
 strip centered on RA 8.0 hr and is one of several thou-
 sands of bright (V <12) stars monitored in this strip
 over the period September 2003 to September 2005. The
 Box-ï¬tting Least Squares algorithm, BLS, (KovÂ´ acs et al.
 2002) was employed to search the nearly 3000 observa-
 tions per star for repetitive transit events with periods
 ranging from P= 0.5âˆ’10 day. We perform the transit
 search on two realizations of the light curve. One re-3

 The phased light curve over the full orbital period. The indi vid-
 ual measurements ( points ) are shown binned ( solid line ) to reduce
 noise. The transit occurs at âˆ† t= 0.0 day and any secondary
 eclipse for a circular orbit would occur at âˆ† t= 1.3 day ( dotted
 line). No secondary eclipse is evident above the noise. At the res -
 olution of the XO cameras, both components of the XO-2 stella r
 binary are within the photometry aperture causing dilution of the
 transit depth.
 alization is the calibrated light curves as described in
 McCullough et al. (2005) and the other realization of
 the light curve has the SysRem algorithm (Tamuz et al.
 2005) applied to the calibrated light curve in order to fur-
 ther remove systematics. In the case of XO-2, there were
 no substantive improvements in the light curve quality
 after implementing SysRem and both analyses identiï¬ed
 the same transit period and phase.
 McCullough & Burke (2007) describe the selection of
 transit candidates for followup. In addition, for consid-
 eration the candidates must pass selection criteria as de-
 scribed in Burke et al. (2006). In brief, we require ob-
 servations covering more than 1.5 transit events, avoid
 0.5 and 1.0 day periods where systematic aliases result
 in false-positive detections, require the transit depth,
 Î´m < 0.1 mag, and require the transit to have higher
 signiï¬cance than systematic errors (as measured by the
 transit to anti-transit Ratio Statistic, RS, of Burke et al.
 (2006)).
 Figure 2 shows the XO light curve phased on the de-
 tected period as returned from BLS. We achieved 0.7%
 or 0.007 mag per observation precision on this V=11.2
 object. The transit occurs at âˆ† t= 0.0 day and any sig-
 nature of a secondary eclipse would occur at âˆ† t= 1.3
 day for a circular orbit. At the angular resolution of the
 XO survey, both components of the XO-2 stellar binary
 are within the photometry aperture leading to transit
 depth dilution. Light curves resolving the components of
 the XO-2 stellar binary result in twice the transit depth
 (see Figure 3), but in the discovery light curve the tran-
 sit depth is 0.007 mag. With the XO cameras, we ob-
 served two nearly complete transits of XO-2b at the end
 of 2004, and beginning of 2005(Julian dates 2453355 and
 2453376). In addition, on seven other nights, XO cam-
 eras captured partial ingress and egress events. First
 occurrence of a partial transit was at the end of 2003
 on Julian date 24552994. Table 1 provides a sample of
 the photometry for XO-2 from the XO cameras. The full
 table is available in the online edition.

 The Extended Team (E.T.) provides photometric fol-
 low up for XO candidates. The E.T. (R. B., M. F., C. F.,
 E. G-M.,B. G., P. H., F. M., G. M., and T. V.) is a
 collaboration of professional and amateur astronomers
 (McCullough et al. 2005, 2006). We sent the candidate
 list containing XO-2 to the E.T. on January 16, 2007.
 On, January 18, 2007, E.T. observations conï¬rmed the
 transit events for XO-2b in the R-band using a 0.6m
 telescope (solid green line in Figure 3). The initial ob-
 servations were truncated due to high air mass, but the
 observations conï¬rmed the XO ephemeris, the transit oc-
 curs in the Northern star of the XO-2 stellar binary, and
 the undiluted transit depth is consistent with a planetary
 radius and the XO photometry. A complete transit was
 observed by the E.T. on January 26, 2007 and the binned
 R-band light curve obtained with a 0.35m telescope is
 shown as the solid red line in Figure 3. The light curves
 shown in Figure 3 are used for reï¬ning the ephemeris
 and looking for evidence of transit timing variations in
 Â§3.4. Based on observations of other transit candidates
 by the E.T., repeat transit events in the same passband
 have a 0.2% or 0.002 mag standard deviation in deriving
 the transit depth. At this level of precision, the E.T.
 observations of XO-2b are consistent with a gray tran-
 sit. Table 1 provides E.T. photometry for XO-2. For the
 E.T. light curves, the median diï¬€erential magnitude out
 of transit provides the ï¬‚ux normalization and the stan-
 dard deviation out of transit provides the uncertainty in
 the measurements.
 On February 16, 2007 we observed a transit event of
 XO-2b with the 1.83m Perkins Telescope at Lowell Ob-
 servatory using the PRISM instrument in imaging mode
 (Janes et al. 2004). The PRISM camera is a 2048x2048
 Fairchild CCD with 0.39â€²â€²/pix resolution. The transit
 event was well positioned in the evening, occurring over
 the airmass range 1.05 /lessorsimilarX/lessorsimilar1.16. To improve eï¬ƒciency
 a subframe containing XO-2N and XO-2S was read out
 with a 8-10 s cadence. The average seeing during the
 course of observations, 3â€²â€², was poor for the site. The ï¬nal
 light curve is a diï¬€erential light curve for XO-2N using
 XO-2S as the comparison shown in Figure 4 employing
 aperture photometry and an R-band ï¬lter. The selected
 aperture size for photometry minimizes the resulting rms
 scatter in the diï¬€erential light curve. In addition to the
 R-band photometry, photometry in the BVI passbands4

 ell Observatory in the R-band ( points ) for XO-2N using XO-2S

 photometry in the B ( diamond ), V (triangle ), and I ( square ) pass-
 bands using the average of the BVI observations obtained bef ore
 the transit for the ï¬‚ux normalization level ( dotted line ). Accurate
 positioning of the stellar image on the detector was not main tained
 during the BVI observations resulting in 0.5% or 0.005 mag sy s-
 tematic oï¬€sets. However, accurate positioning of the stell ar image
 on the detector was maintained during the R-band light curve re-
 sulting in âˆ¼0.0014 mag rms over 1 minute intervals. Also shown is
 the best-ï¬t transit model for ï¬xed Mâ‹†= 0.98MâŠ™(solid line ).
 was obtained before the transit, at mid-transit, and after
 the transit. The gap in the R-band data at mid-transit
 accommodates the multiple ï¬lter data. A computer fail-
 ure resulted in the gap of R-band data at the start of
 ingress.
 To normalize the diï¬€erential light curve, the average
 magnitude from out of transit data was subtracted from
 the light curve. This was done independently for each
 half of the light curve separated by the mid-transit gap.
 There is a âˆ† m= 0.001 magnitude diï¬€erence in the nor-
 malization zeropoints between the data before and after
 the transit. This oï¬€set results from repositioning the
 telescope and refocusing for the BVI data acquisition at
 mid-transit. During an uninterrupted R-band data se-
 ries, a 0.3 pix rms positional accuracy was maintained
 resulting in âˆ¼0.0014 mag rms over 1 minute intervals.
 Accurate positioning was not maintained for the BVI
 data resulting in âˆ¼âˆ†0.005 mag oï¬€sets between the data
 obtained before and after the transit. The average BVI
 passband data before transit was subtracted from the
 BVI data obtained at mid-transit and after transit to
 yield the diï¬€erential light curve in these passbands as
 shown in Figure 4. Within the systematics resulting from
 repositioning of the stars on the detector, the transit is
 gray.
 We obtained photometric B, V, R C, and I Cmagni-
 tudes for XO-2N and XO-2S using a 0.35m telescope on
 the photometric night of January 24, 2007 (Table 2).
 A single Landolt area (Landolt 1992) was observed at
 the same airmass as XO-2 to derive the zero point and
 color transformation coeï¬ƒcients. The color transfor-
 mation coeï¬ƒcients were consistent with comprehensive
 standard star measurements from four Landolt ï¬elds ob-
 tained two weeks previous using the identical instrumen-
 tal setup. The color range of Landolt standards was
 âˆ’0.14â‰¤(Bâˆ’V)â‰¤1.4. The B, V, R C, and I Cabsolute
 photometric accuracies are 0.04, 0.04, 0.04, and 0.05 mag
 r.m.s., including both the rms scatter around the photo-
 metric transformation model and an estimated system-
 atic error. The Tycho-2 magnitudes for XO-2 listed inTable 2 transform (via Table 2 of Bessell (2000)) to John-
 sonV= 11.25, i.e. 0.07 mag (2- Ïƒ) fainter than our es-
 timate. In addition, we accurately measured the instru-
 mental magnitude diï¬€erence between XO-2N and XO-
 2S. We ï¬nd XO-2N is fainter than XO-2S by 0.07 Â±0.008
 mag in the B-band, 0.055 Â±0.004 mag in the V-band,
 0.040Â±0.004 mag in the R-band, and 0.030 Â±0.003 mag
 in the I-band.
 2.3.Spectroscopy
 After conï¬rmation of the XO transit light curve
 from E.T. observations (see Â§2.2), we initiated queue
 schedule observations of XO-2N and XO-2S with the
 High-Resolution Spectrograph (HRS), a ï¬ber fed cross-
 dispersed echelle spectrograph (Tull 1998), on the
 McDonald Observatory 11-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope
 (HET) in order to measure the mass of the planet. The
 ï¬rst HRS observations using an iodine gas cell for pre-
 cision radial velocities commenced on January 26, 2007.
 Table 3 provides dates of the HRS observations along
 with the resulting radial velocities. The instrument setup
 provides R=60,000 resolution and wavelength coverage
 over the range 4000 < Î» < 7800ËšAwith center at Î»=
 5900ËšA. We extracted the two-dimensional echelle spec-
 tra using procedures described in Hinkle et al. (2000).
 The resulting Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) varied from
 20-50 per extracted pixel at the blaze peak. We calcu-
 late radial velocities for XO-2N and XO-2S in Â§3.3.
 To measure the stellar parameters of XO-2N and XO-
 2S, we also obtained spectra with the 2dCoudÂ´ e echelle
 spectrometer (Tull et al. 1995) on the McDonald Obser-
 vatory 2.7-m Harlan J. Smith Telescope (HJS). We ob-
 tained two spectra of XO-2N and a single spectrum of
 XO-2S with R=60,000 and wavelength coverage of 3900-
 9600ËšA. We determine the stellar parameters in Â§3.1.
 3.ANALYSIS
 3.1.Stellar Properties
 We use the Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) analysis
 package of Valenti & Piskunov (1996) with reï¬nements
 from Valenti & Fischer (2005) on the HJS spectra to
 measure the stellar properties of XO-2N and XO-2S.
 We brieï¬‚y describe the process here. The free param-
 eters of Teff, logg, [M/H], vsini, [Na/H], [Si/H], [Ti/H],
 [Fe/H], and [Ni/H] are varied in order to minimize the
 diï¬€erence of the resulting synthetic spectrum to the ob-
 served spectrum. A quadratic continuum is ï¬t over 8
 wavelength intervals for each unique set of the above
 free parameters. When generating the synthetic spec-
 trum, the pressure-temperature proï¬le of the atmosphere
 comes from interpolating the atmosphere grid of Kurucz
 (1992). The atomic line list comes from the Vienna
 Atomic Line Database (VALD) (Piskunov et al. 1995)
 and the molecular line list comes from Kurucz (1993).
 The line strengths and van der Waals damping parameter
 of the line list database were adjusted to improve agree-
 ment with the observed solar spectrum, as described in
 Valenti & Fischer (2005).
 Table 4 lists the stellar parameters for XO-2N and XO-
 2S based on the SME analysis. The results for XO-2N
 are based on the average from two spectra and the results
 for XO-2S are based on a single spectrum. Both XO-
 2N and XO-2S independently result in a metal enhanced5
 abundance, [Fe/H]=0.45 Â±0.02. Using the primary ob-
 servables from the SME analysis ( Teff, abundances, and
 logg) and the apparent magnitude in the V-band ( Â§2.2),
 we determine secondary stellar properties, Mâ‹†,Râ‹†, dis-
 tance, and age using the Y2isochrones (Yi et al. 2001)
 following the procedure of Valenti & Fischer (2005). The
 distance to XO-2 is unknown, thus the probability den-
 sity function for Mâ‹†,Râ‹†, and age are calculated for a
 sequence of trial distances in steps of 10 pc. The SME
 isochrone analysis for select distances to XO-2 are listed
 in Table 5. We determine a distance, d=149 pc, to XO-2
 inÂ§3.2.2 from a joint analysis of the SME analysis and
 transit light curve.
 The spectrum alone yields an estimate of the stel-
 lar gravity, log gsme. Estimates of Mâ‹†andRâ‹†from
 the isochrone analysis provide an additional estimate of
 loggisoas a function of distance to XO-2. The condition
 loggsme=loggisoyields an approximate distance to XO-
 2. The data for XO-2S provides a consistency check, and
 ideally the condition log gsme=loggisofor XO-2S is met
 for the same distance as XO-2N. In practice, we ï¬nd XO-
 2S has log gsme= 4.6; too large a value for log gisoto ac-
 commodate at any distance. Also, XO-2S being brighter
 and thus more massive than XO-2N implies log gsmefor
 XO-2S should be lower than log gsme= 4.5 of XO-2N,
 opposite of what is measured.
 Evidence that log gsmefor XO-2N is correct and the re-
 sulting log gsmefor XO-2S is overestimated is as follows.
 As we show in Â§3.2.1, the independent determination
 of loggfor XO-2N based on the transit light curve is in
 excellent agreement with log gsme. The SME based log g
 can result in higher values than the Y2isochrones al-
 low for some objects in the Spectroscopic Properties of
 Cool Stars (SPOCS) catalog as a result of the numerous
 degeneracies that exist between the spectral parameters
 (see Figure 16 of Valenti & Fischer (2005)). Comparing
 stars analyzed with SME in common with other inde-
 pendent spectral analyses does not reveal an oï¬€set in
 logg(see Figure 20 of Valenti & Fischer (2005)). The 1-
 Ïƒuncertainties in the stellar parameters given in Table 4
 are based on the typical rms scatter in parameters mea-
 sured in independent, multiple spectra for stars in the
 SPOCS catalog. Based on the 1- Ïƒuncertainties in Ta-
 ble 4, the diï¬€erence in log gbetween XO-2N and XO-2S is
 signiï¬cant. However, the distribution of repeat measure-
 ments for parameters in the SPOCS catalog (see Table
 5 of Valenti & Fischer (2005)) display extended wings
 and the Gaussian-based uncertainties underestimate the
 possibility of outlying measurements. Thus, we also pro-
 vide the 99.7% conï¬dence intervals for the parameters
 based on Table 5 of Valenti & Fischer (2005). Since, the
 XO-2S parameters are based on a single spectrum, the
 99.7% conï¬dence interval is more appropriate than rely-
 ing solely on the 1- Ïƒerror when deciding on the signiï¬-
 cance of any diï¬€erences between the properties of XO-2N
 and XO-2S.
 We show the probability density for the XO-2N pa-
 rameters in Figure 5 for the preferred distance to XO-2
 of 149 pc. We perform a combined analysis of the stel-
 lar parameters from the SME analysis and light curve to
 derive the best stellar and planet properties in Â§3.2.2.

 Using the stellar properties from the SME analysis (see
 Â§3.1) and the transit light curve from the 1.8m Perkins
 Telescope (see Â§2.2), we model the transit light curve
 jointly with the SME stellar properties to determine the
 parameters of XO-2 and radius of XO-2b. In the follow-
 ing subsections, we ï¬rst determine the system parame-
 ters from the light curve using a Maximum Likelihood, Ï‡2
 minimization, method assuming ï¬xed Mâ‹†and employing
 theoretical limb darkening coeï¬ƒcients. Then, we further
 reï¬ne the system parameters and their uncertainty by
 marginalizing over the unknown limb darkening param-
 eters and using a prior on Mâ‹†from the SME analysis
 using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.
 3.2.1. Maximum Likelihood Analysis of the Light Curve
 In Figure 6 we show the Mâ‹†andRâ‹†parameter space
 for XO-2 allowed by the SME analysis. The horizontal
 error bars delimit the 68% credible intervals for the mass
 of XO-2. Each error bar corresponds to an assumed dis-
 tance to XO-2 as labeled in Figure 6. The ordinate loca-
 tion for each error bar is given by the best estimate of Râ‹†
 for XO-2 as determined from the SME analysis for the as-
 sumed distance. The SME analysis constrains the stellar
 mass of XO-2 to a narrow range Mâ‹†= 0.98Â±0.02MâŠ™in-
 dependent of the distance. First, we determine the XO-2
 and XO-2b system parameters at ï¬xed Mâ‹†= 0.98MâŠ™.
 We perform a Ï‡2minimization using data obtained
 at the 1.8m Perkins Telescope from February 16, 2007
 shown in Figure 4. To obtain limb darkening coeï¬ƒcients,
 we interpolate in the table of the quadratic limb darken-
 ing law coeï¬ƒcients from Claret (2000). Using the spec-
 troscopically determined iron abundance, log g, andTeff
 we ï¬nd u1= 0.446 and u2= 0.265. The limb darkening
 coeï¬ƒcients are held ï¬xed throughout the minimization.
 With Rp, orbital inclination i, and time oï¬€set from the
 XO ephemeris as free parameters and the assumption
 of a circular orbit, we minimize the Ï‡2diï¬€erence be-
 tween observations and the analytic transit model from
 Mandel & Agol (2002). To estimate errors for the data
 points, we calculate the sample standard deviation for6
 groups of 5 measurements (i.e. roughly 1 minute inter-
 vals). There is a linear trend in the resulting error esti-
 mates that ranges from 0.0013 mag to 0.0015 mag over
 the course of the observations with error estimates rang-
 ing from 0.0005 â‰¤Ïƒâ‰¤0.0025 mag. Given the roughly
 constant trend in the error estimates as a function of
 time, we adopt uniform errors, Ïƒ=0.0014 mag, for all
 measurements.
 Table 6 lists the resulting best-ï¬t system parame-
 ters and their errors. For the best set of parameters,
 Ï‡2
 min= 912 with 730 degrees of freedom for a reduced
 Ï‡2
 Î½= 1.25. This suggests our errors are underestimated,
 the model (limb darkening coeï¬ƒcients) is inappropriate,
 or the assumption of independent Gaussian noise is incor-
 rect. We assume the former is plausible, since increasing
 the scale of errors by 10% achieves Ï‡2
 Î½= 1. We quantify
 the impact of allowing the limb darkening parameters
 to vary in Â§3.2.2. We scale the error estimate for the
 observations to ensure Ï‡2
 Î½= 1 when deriving the 1- Ïƒ
 error on each parameter. We determine the 1- Ïƒerror
 on each parameter by varying an individual parameter
 while allowing the other parameters to minimize Ï‡2un-
 til âˆ†Ï‡2=Ï‡2âˆ’Ï‡2
 min= 1 (Press et al. 1992).
 Râ‹†as measured from the transit light curve ï¬t enables
 estimating the distance to XO-2 and age of XO-2 by em-
 ploying the results from the SME isochrone analysis. We
 interpolate the stellar radius versus trial distance to XO-
 2 relationship given by the SME isochrone analysis. The
 estimated distance to XO-2 and its error follows directly
 from the interpolated result at the Ï‡2minimization esti-
 mate for Râ‹†and its error. The best age for XO-2 follows
 the same procedure as for the distance (i.e., for a given
 stellar radius estimate, the SME isochrone analysis has
 a best age estimate for the system).
 To further visualize the Ï‡2surface over the range of
 Mâ‹†andRâ‹†for XO-2, we perform a grid-based Ï‡2ï¬t to
 the light curve over the grid 0 .85< R â‹†<1.5RâŠ™and
 0.94< M â‹†<1.04MâŠ™with steps in âˆ† Râ‹†= 0.00312 and
 âˆ†Mâ‹†= 0.01. The limb darkening coeï¬ƒcients are ï¬xed
 at the theoretical estimate throughout the calculation.
 Figure 6 shows the 1, 2, and 3- Ïƒconï¬dence intervals
 (âˆ†Ï‡2=Ï‡2âˆ’Ï‡2
 min=2.3, 6.17, and 11.8, respectively) in
 theMâ‹†-Râ‹†grid as the nearly horizontal solid lines. The
 constraint on Râ‹†from the transit photometry is nearly
 perpendicular to the constraint on Mâ‹†provided by the
 SME analysis of the spectra. Figure 6 illustrates each
 constraint with hatched lines; the cross-hatched region
 is the intersection of the two constraints and indicates
 the joint 1- Ïƒconï¬dence interval on Mâ‹†andRâ‹†for XO-2.
 Also shown as the dashed lines is the spectroscopically
 measured log gfor XO-2 and its conï¬dence intervals as
 labeled. The measured log gsmeis consistent with the
 conï¬dence intervals from the light curve constraints.
 In the following subsection, we describe a Bayesian
 method for analyzing the XO-2 light curve and SME
 spectra data, and we relax the assumption of ï¬xed limb
 darkening coeï¬ƒcients and Mâ‹†. By keeping track of the
 likelihood, eâˆ’0.5Ï‡2, during the Bayesian calculation, we
 approximate the resulting XO-2 and XO-2b parameters
 derived from the Maximum Likelihood, Ï‡2minimization,
 method presented in this subsection. Table 6 provides
 full results for both the Ï‡2method and MCMC method
 for incremental increase in the number of free parametersFig. 6.â€” Constraints on the mass and radius of XO-2. The
 nearly horizontal ( solid) line shows the conï¬dence intervals for the
 parameters of XO-2 from ï¬tting the transit light curve shown in
 Figure 4. The connected horizontal ( error bars ) represent the lim-

 The label on each error bar provides the assumed distance to X O-2

 sis (dashed line labeled XO-2 log g) agrees with the log gestimated

 straints for the light curve and spectra analysis. The cross -hatching

 Figures 8-12 show the uncertainties on parameters that
 result from the Ï‡2minimization method and enable their
 comparison to the uncertainties from the MCMC method
 (solid vertical lines). A discussion of the diï¬€erences be-
 tween the two analysis methods is given in the following
 subsection.
 3.2.2. Markov Chain Monte Carlo Analysis of the Light
 Curve
 In summary, a Bayesian analysis updates the prior
 probability of a hypothesis to a posterior probability of
 the hypothesis that includes the information provided by
 the data as quantiï¬ed by the likelihood,
 Posterior Probability âˆPrior Probability Ã—Likelihood.
 (1)
 The resulting posterior probability is a probability den-
 sity for the parameter/s of interest given the observed
 data. Bayesian analysis has been applied to determin-
 ing the system properties for transiting extrasolar plan-
 ets (Holman et al. 2006) and for radial velocity extra-
 solar planets (Ford 2005; Gregory 2005b). In a mul-
 tidimensional problem the MCMC algorithm is an eï¬ƒ-
 cient means of calculating the posterior probability. Ford
 (2005) provides a thorough discussion of the theory and
 a practical MCMC implementation for radial velocity
 planet detection. Qualitatively, a Markov Chain is a se-
 ries of samplings from parameter space. A random (i.e.
 Monte Carlo) step from the current sample to a trial sam-
 ple is taken. A selection function based on the posterior
 probability decides whether to accept this trial sample
 or maintain the current sample as the next step of the
 chain. In the end, the distribution of samples in the chain
 converges to the posterior probability of interest.
 Holman et al. (2006) determined the system parame-
 ters for XO-1b (McCullough et al. 2006) with a MCMC
 Bayesian approach. The set of parameters they investi-
 gated were stellar radius, Râ‹†, planet radius, Rp, orbital
 inclination, i, and the two coeï¬ƒcients of the quadratic7

 MCMC calculation of the XO-2b posterior distribution for a ï¬ xed
 stellar mass, M= 0.98MâŠ™, and stellar limb darkening coeï¬ƒcients,
 u1= 0.446 and u2= 0.265. When using the parameters, Râ‹†,Rp,
 andi, the parameters are tightly correlated and the Rpversus i
 correlation is nonlinear ( Top). With the choice of parameters, Râ‹†,
 Ï, and Ï„, the correlations between parameters are linear ( Middle ).
 Solving for the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix from s amples
 shown in the Middle Panel yields an eigenbasis set of paramet ers
 (Lower ). The eigenvector along the direction of largest variance,
 e1is predominately along Râ‹†. Eigenvectors e2ande3are a mix-
 ture of ÏandÏ„. The multi-normal without covariance properties of

 limb darkening law. In the transit ï¬tting problem, the re-
 lationship between Râ‹†,Rp, andihas a high degree of de-
 generacy and nonlinearity. We illustrate the degeneracy
 and nonlinearity between parameters in the top panels
 of Figure 7 for a MCMC calculation of the XO-2b poste-
 rior distribution maintaining ï¬xed mass, M= 0.98MâŠ™,
 and ï¬xed limb darkening coeï¬ƒcients, u1= 0.45 and
 u2= 0.26. The points in Figure 7 are samples from the
 MCMC. The nonlinear, â€banana-shapedâ€ degeneracy be-
 tween Rpandislows the rate of convergence for MCMC
 algorithms. MCMC algorithms work eï¬ƒciently when the
 relationship between parameters is multi-normal without
 covariance (Kosowsky et al. 2002).
 To remove the nonlinearity between parameters, we
 choose a diï¬€erent base set of parameters, Râ‹†,Ï=Rp/Râ‹†,
 and transit duration,

 where Pis the orbital period, ais the semi-major axis,
 and we have assumed zero eccentricity. With this nonlin-
 ear transformation, the degeneracy between the new base
 set of parameters is along a straight line as shown in the
 middle panels of Figure 7. A further linear transforma-
 tion between parameters ï¬nally yields the simple multi-
 normal without covariance relationship that results in an
 eï¬ƒcient MCMC calculation. To determine the necessary
 linear transformation, we determine the eigenvectors of
 the covariance matrix built from a trial chain performed
 in the base set of parameters (Tegmark et al. 2004). This
 is equivalent to a Principal Component Analysis. The
 bottom panels in Figure 7 show trial samples in terms of
 the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. The eigenvec-
 tor along the largest variance, e1, is predominately along
 Râ‹†, and e2ande3are a mixture of ÏandÏ„.
 Care must be taken to properly assign prior prob-
 abilities for a nonlinear transformation in parameters
 (Chu et al. 2003). In particular, a uniform prior in iisnot the same as a uniform prior in Ï„. The transformation
 law of probabilities provides the necessary prior probabil -
 ity to maintain the uniform prior in Râ‹†,Rp, andifor our
 chosen base set of parameters. We initially investigate a
 uniform prior in ito enable comparison with our Ï‡2mini-
 mization. We subsequently implement a prior uniform in
 cosias appropriate for the distribution of iexpected for
 random orientations of the orbital plane, and we ï¬nd a
 negligible diï¬€erence in the resulting parameters between
 the two choices of prior for ias expected since iâ‰ƒ90â—¦.

 With our base set of parameters, the proper prior to
 maintain uniform priors in the original parameters is the
 above Jacobian multiplied by the original joint probabil-
 ity distribution for uniform priors, which is a constant.
 To solve for iin Equation 2, we use the root-solving
 method of (Muller 1956) as implemented in IDL. The
 prior probability goes to zero for 0 < Ï„ < Ï„ max, where
 Ï„max=P/Ï€arcsin( Râ‹†/a)(1 +Ï).
 We employ the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a
 normal proposal distribution for calculating the Markov
 Chain. We follow a Gibbs-like sampling technique where
 each step in the chain consists of a number of intra steps
 updating each individual parameter in turn. Several
 short, trial chains iteratively yield scale factors of the
 normal proposal distribution for each parameter with a
 25% to 40% acceptance rate for the trial samples. The
 autocorrelation of samples in the MCMC sequence is
 one method to quantify the eï¬ƒciency of the calculation.
 With the original set of parameters ( Râ‹†,Rp, and i), the
 correlation length (when the autocorrelation drops by
 half) in the Râ‹†parameter varied, 500 < N cor<1500
 steps. Using our new set of parameters ( Râ‹†,Ï, and Ï„),8
 40< N cor<60 steps. Finally, with the eigenbasis pa-
 rameters, 4 < N cor<5 steps, where the correlation is
 measured in the physical variable Râ‹†. The above corre-
 lation lengths come from the calculation described next.
 We ï¬rst calculate the posterior distribution for the pa-
 rameters of XO-2 and XO-2b with the MCMC algorithm
 as described above at ï¬xed stellar mass, M= 0.98MâŠ™,
 and ï¬xed stellar limb darkening coeï¬ƒcients, u1= 0.446
 andu2= 0.265. This is identical to the problem we
 solved with the Ï‡2minimization method in Â§3.2.1. The
 likelihood function is given by eâˆ’0.5Ï‡2, were we have as-
 sumed the errors are normally distributed, and the data
 have uniform weights. Ï‡2is the squared diï¬€erence be-
 tween observations and the analytic transit model of
 Mandel & Agol (2002). The observations are the R-band
 data from the 1.8m Perkins Telescope shown in Figure 4.
 The calculation has four free parameters, Râ‹†,Ï,Ï„,
 andto, where tois the mid-transit time oï¬€set from the
 ephemeris with a period given by the XO observations
 and a mid-transit zeropoint near the mid-transit gap of
 the light curve, HJD 2454147.75. Our prior is given by
 Equation 6, which is equivalent to a prior uniform in Râ‹†,
 Rp,i, and to. The priors for Râ‹†,Ï, and tohave cut-
 oï¬€ values well beyond values allowed by the data. The
 prior on Ï„has an upper limit cutoï¬€, Ï„ < Ï„ max. A trial
 chain in the base parameters is necessary to deï¬ne the
 covariance matrix and the eigenbasis set of parameters.
 OnlyRâ‹†,Ï, and Ï„enter into the covariance matrix. We
 ï¬ndtoshows no signiï¬cant correlation with respect to
 the other three parameters. The trial chain has a length,
 Nchn= 24000 steps. The ï¬nal estimate of the poste-
 rior probability comes from 7 independent chains with
 diï¬€erent initial conditions using the eigenbasis parame-
 ters each with Nchn= 20000 giving an eï¬€ective length
 Neff=Nchn/Ncor= 4000 after taking into account the
 correlation length Ncor= 5. Using these 7 chains, the
 largest Gelman-Rubin statistic amongst the parameters,
 R=1.0037, where R <1.02 indicates convergence of the
 chain (Gelman & Rubin 1992).
 Figure 8 shows the resulting posterior probability dis-
 tribution for each parameter after marginalization over
 the other parameters. The posterior probability is sim-
 ply a normalized histogram of the MCMC sample values.
 The mean, median, or mode are all valid single point es-
 timates of the posterior probability. The mode of the
 posterior probability yields parameters most consistent
 with the maximum likelihood parameters from a Ï‡2min-
 imization. The arrow point along the abscissa in Figure 8
 indicates the mode of the posterior probability. To de-
 rive an Î±% credible interval for a parameter, the MCMC
 samples are separated into two groups on each side of
 the posterior mode and sorted. The (1 âˆ’Î±)Nth
 lowsample
 from the group of sorted samples below the mode deï¬nes
 the lower limit of the credible interval, where Nlowis the
 number of samples in this group. The Î±Nth
 highsample
 from the group of sorted samples above the mode deï¬nes
 the upper limit of the credible interval, where Nhighis
 the number of samples in this group. The vertical solid
 lines in Figure 8 show the 68.3% credible interval. The
 best parameter values and credible intervals are given in
 Table 6.
 By keeping track of the likelihood value, eâˆ’0.5Ï‡2, at
 each MCMC sample, it is possible to approximate aFig. 8.â€” Marginalized posterior probability for the XO-2 and
 XO-2b parameters from MCMC samples assuming ï¬xed stellar

 samples that approximate uncertainties from a Ï‡2minimization

 nation parameter.
 conï¬dence interval based on a speciï¬ed âˆ† Ï‡2interval.
 With good sampling, the MCMC sample with the largest
 likelihood, Lmax, in each bin of the posterior probability
 histogram approximates minimizing Ï‡2at the abscissa
 value of the bin. To determine the conï¬dence interval
 limits, we spline ï¬t the sequence of Lmaxas a function
 of the parameter of interest. A 1- Ïƒconï¬dence inter-
 val is determined for the parameter value resulting in
 Lmax= 0.606, corresponding to âˆ† Ï‡2= 1. The verti-
 cal dotted lines in Figure 8 represent the 1- Ïƒconï¬dence
 intervals determined from this process.
 In the next calculation, we include the stellar limb
 darkening coeï¬ƒcients as free parameters. We model the
 limb darkening with the quadratic law, I= 1âˆ’u1(1âˆ’
 Âµ)âˆ’u2(1âˆ’Âµ)2, where Iis the speciï¬c intensity normal-
 ized to unity at the center of the stellar disk and Âµis
 the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the
 surface normal. We assume uniform priors for the limb
 darkening coeï¬ƒcients with the following physically mo-
 tivated limits on the parameters. We require the high-
 est surface brightness to be located at the disk center
 (u1â‰¥0.0), require the speciï¬c intensity to remain above
 zero ( u1+u2â‰¤1.0), and do not allow limb-brightened
 proï¬les ( u1+2u2â‰¥0.0). We follow Holman et al. (2006)
 by adopting a1=u1+ 2u2anda2= 2u1âˆ’u2as the
 parameters used in the calculation. This linear combina-
 tion of limb darkening coeï¬ƒcients reduces their mutual
 degeneracy. The trial chain to determine the covariance
 matrix was length, Nchn= 40000. Râ‹†,Ï,i,a1, and a2
 were included in the covariance matrix. The ï¬nal esti-
 mate of the posterior probability comes from 7 indepen-
 dent chains each with Nchn= 30000 giving Neffâˆ¼6000.
 Using these 7 chains, the largest Gelman-Rubin statistic
 was R=1.001.
 Figure 9 shows the marginalized posterior probabil-
 ity allowing the stellar limb darkening coeï¬ƒcients to
 vary. This results in a smaller star, smaller planet, and
 shorter duration than for the ï¬xed limb darkening coef-
 ï¬cient case. The conï¬dence intervals are systematically
 oï¬€set from the Bayesian credible intervals. In this in-
 stance, a Ï‡2analysis results in a smaller Rpthan the9

 Bayesian mode of the marginalized posterior probability.
 The marginalized posterior probability will diï¬€er in gen-
 eral from the likelihood. For instance, the marginalized
 posterior probability will diï¬€er if an informative prior
 is employed. Also, the process of marginalization itself
 can result in a posterior probability diï¬€erent than the
 likelihood. This is because the marginalized probabil-
 ity includes the eï¬€ect of the amount of parameter space
 available at each point (Lewis & Bridle 2002). To illus-
 trate this point, we show the joint posterior probabil-
 ity for Râ‹†andu2in the right panel of Figure 10. The
 open diamond indicates the best set of parameters which
 minimize Ï‡2. The best parameters are in a â€cornerâ€ of
 allowed parameter space. Even though the likelihood is
 highest at Râ‹†âˆ¼0.955, there is a wider range of allowed
 parameter space in the u2parameter toward larger Râ‹†.
 Thus, the peak in the marginalized posterior probabil-
 ity is slightly larger, Râ‹†= 0.96. The diï¬€erence between
 the results is small, but it can be an important factor
 to take into consideration when comparing datasets or
 results derived from the two techniques (Lewis & Bridle
 2002).

 for the limb darkening coeï¬ƒcients. The lower dash line
 in Figure 10 corresponds to not allowing limb brightened
 speciï¬c intensity proï¬les. The best-ï¬t transit model in
 aÏ‡2sense from this calculation is compared to the light
 curve data in Figure 4.
 The ï¬nal parameter of the system that we investigate is
 Mâ‹†. In the preceding calculations, Mâ‹†is held ï¬xed. The
 light curve data alone does not constrain Mâ‹†, thus we
 calculate the posterior probability employing the prior
 onMâ‹†available from the SME isochrone analysis. The
 form of the prior is a Gaussian where the central value
 and standard deviation of the Gaussian are a function of
 Râ‹†. We employ a spline interpolation over the grid of Mâ‹†
 andÏƒMas a function of Râ‹†as shown by the horizontal
 error bars in Figure 6. The trial chain to determine the
 covariance matrix was length, Nchn= 70000 steps. The
 ï¬nal estimate of the posterior probability comes from
 7 independent chains each with Nchn= 60000 giving
 Neffâˆ¼12000. Using these 7 chains, the largest Gelman-
 Rubin statistic was R=1.0002.
 The resulting posterior probability is shown in Fig-
 ure 11. The conï¬dence intervals from a Ï‡2analysis for
 Râ‹†andRpare technically much wider than shown in Fig-
 ure 11. The conï¬dence intervals are limited by the range
 ofMâ‹†encountered in the MCMC samples allowed by
 the SME Gaussian-like prior as shown in Figure 12. Us-
 ing the SME isochrone analysis, we translate the MCMC
 samples for Râ‹†into distance to XO-2 and age estimates.
 The posterior probability for these two parameters is
 shown in Figure 12. We repeated the last calculation
 assuming a prior uniform in cos i. The results are given
 in Table 6, and they do not materially aï¬€ect the param-
 eter estimates.
 3.3.Radial Velocity Measurements
 We measured the mass of XO-2b using the radial veloc-
 ity technique. We follow the procedure to determine the
 radial velocity as described in McCullough et al. (2006).
 A brief summary is as follows. The spectra obtained with
 the HET are compared to a model spectrum consisting of
 a high-resolution spectrum of the Sun, the Earthâ€™s atmo-
 sphere (Wallace et al. 1998), and a high-resolution spec-10

 trum of an iodine gas cell (Cochran 2000) convolved with
 a Voigt proï¬le to approximate the line-spread-function of
 the instrument. Using a continuum normalization factor,
 radial velocity of the star, radial velocity of the iodine
 lines, and an optical depth scale factor as free param-
 eters of the model, a Ï‡2minimization yields parame-
 ter estimates for each âˆ¼15ËšA section of the spectrum
 independently. The requirement of strong iodine lines
 limits radial velocity estimates to the wavelength range
 5210< Î» < 5700ËšA. The mean and its error of the inde-
 pendent radial velocity estimates yields the ï¬nal radial
 velocity measurement at each epoch (see Table 3).
 Figure 13 shows the resulting radial velocity curve
 phased with the XO-2b ephemeris determined from the
 transits and assuming zero eccentricity. The typical un-
 certainty for each measurement, ÏƒRV= 20 m sâˆ’1. The
 radial velocity semi-amplitude, K=85 Â±8 m sâˆ’1. This
 amplitude results in Mp=0.57Â±0.06 M Jfor XO-2b, as-
 suming Mâ‹†=0.98 M âŠ™for XO-2 and a circular orbit for
 XO-2b. The six radial velocities measured for XO-2S
 (Table 3) are consistent within the observational errors
 with no radial velocity variation and show no signiï¬cant
 evidence for a HJ orbiting XO-2S.
 3.4.Ephemeris and Transit Timing Variations
 The database of E.T. transit light curves for XO-2b en-
 able us to reï¬ne the ephemeris for XO-2b and to quantify
 transit timing variations from this ephemeris. The tran-
 sit light from the 1.8m Perkins Telescope on February 16,
 2007 provides a precise measurement of the mid-transit
 zeropoint of XO-2b. From the best ï¬tting transit model
 in aÏ‡2sense during the MCMC calculation at ï¬xed
 Mâ‹†= 0.98MâŠ™and variable limb darkening coeï¬ƒcients,
 we ï¬nd the ephemeris zeropoint is 2454147.74902 Â±0.0002
 day. The error (17 s) corresponds to the 1- Ïƒconï¬dence
 interval for the ephemeris zeropoint from a Ï‡2analysis
 as estimated from the MCMC samples following the pro-
 cedure of Â§3.2.2.
 To reï¬ne the orbital period of XO-2b, we calculate mid-
 transit times for the nearly complete transit events ob-
 served with the XO cameras on 2453355 and 2453376
 HJD and the E.T. transit events shown in Figure 3. We
 compare the E.T. transit data with a simpliï¬ed trape-
 zoidal transit model. The transit model has a constantFig. 13.â€” a) The radial velocity of XO-2 oscillates sinusoidally
 with a semi-amplitude K = 85 Â±8 m sâˆ’1, implying XO-2bâ€™s mass is
 0.57Â±0.06 M J. b) The period and phase of the radial velocities were
 ï¬xed at values determined by the transits. The mean stellar r adial
 velocity with respect to the solar systemâ€™s barycenter has b een

 ï¬‚ux decrement, Ï2, between 2ndand 3rdcontact with
 a linear variation in the ï¬‚ux during ingress and egress.
 Values of ÏandÏ„for the trapezoidal transit model come
 from the best ï¬tting transit model in a Ï‡2sense dur-
 ing the MCMC calculation at ï¬xed Mâ‹†= 0.98MâŠ™and
 variable limb darkening coeï¬ƒcients. The transit model
 has a ï¬‚ux decrement of Ï2/2 when applied to the XO
 survey data to account for the transit depth dilution
 caused by the ï¬‚ux of XO-2S in the photometric aper-
 ture. Table 7 provides the resulting mid-transit times.
 The four independent mid-transit estimates on 2454168
 HJD enables estimating the typical uncertainty (1- Ïƒ=5.5
 min) in the transit timing. To reï¬ne the orbital pe-
 riod we minimize the Ï‡2diï¬€erence between the tran-
 sit timing observations and ephemeris model. We keep
 the ephemeris zeropoint ï¬xed at the value derived from
 the 1.8m Perkins Telescope light curve. The best-ï¬t pe-
 riod, 2.615838 Â±0.000008 day, results in a Ï‡2
 min= 10.7
 forÎ½=13 degrees of freedom. This suggests there are no
 signiï¬cant timing variations. For the minimization we
 assumed a uniform error, Ïƒ=5.5 min, on the transit tim-
 ings. This error may be slightly overestimated given the
 resulting Ï‡2
 min. The ephemeris for XO-2b accumulates a
 5 min uncertainty by 2010.
 4.DISCUSSION
 Amongst the various estimates for the system param-
 eters given in Table 6, our preferred system parameters
 and uncertainties for XO-2 and XO-2b come from the
 MCMC calculation of the posterior probability that em-
 ploys the SME based prior on the stellar mass and uni-
 form priors for the other parameters. We show how the
 mass and radius of XO-2b compares to the other known
 transiting extrasolar planets in Figure 14. Data for the
 other transiting planets comes from the compilation of
 F. Pont (priv. comm.)13. We summarize the preferred
 properties of XO-2b in Table 8.

 tent with a planet. However, in the case of XO-2b, our
 attempts to explain the light curve and spectroscopy with
 a physical stellar triple fail. We employ the Y2isochrone
 appropriate for the the physical properties of XO-2 sup-
 plemented with the low-mass stellar isochrone between
 0.072< M â‹†<0.5 M âŠ™from Chabrier et al. (2000), stellar
 limb darkening coeï¬ƒcients from Claret (2000), and the
 light curve synthesis routine of Wilson (1993) to model
 a stellar triple system. The constraints on the transit
 duration and transit depth from the light curve require
 Mâ‹†>0.95 M âŠ™for the primary in a stellar binary blended
 with the light of XO-2. The required stellar binary has
 >75% the ï¬‚ux of XO-2 and has a radial velocity semi-
 amplitude, K >16 km sâˆ’1. Such a binary would be read-
 ily apparent in the spectrum of XO-2 given the narrow
 spectral features for XO-2, vsini <2.3 km sâˆ’1. We can-
 not completely rule out the possibility of a line-of-sight
 faint background binary blended with the light of XO-
 2 as an explanation for the observations. However, the
 sinusoidal shape of the radial velocity variations necessi -
 tate the line-of-sight binary to have a systemic velocity
 similar to XO-2 otherwise the radial velocity curve de-
 velops asymmetries that are not observed (Torres et al.
 2005). Given the large proper motion of XO-2, ground-
 based adaptive optics or space-based observations have
 the potential to deï¬nitively rule out a background line-
 of-sight binary.
 In addition to XO-2, only HAT-P-1, HD 20782, HD
 80606, HD 99492 (GJ 429B), HD 178911B, and HD
 186427 (16 Cyg B) have âˆ† V <2.0 mag diï¬€erence between
 the stellar binary components (Desidera & Barbieri
 2007, supplemented by data from the SIMBAD
 database) and can be considered nearly-equal-mass stel-
 lar binaries hosting a known extrasolar planet. In 5 out
 of the 7 binary systems, the planet orbits the lower mass
 star of the binary. In the remaining 2 systems, HD 20782
 and HD 80606, the planet orbits the more massive star,
 but the orbits for these planets have the highest eccen-
 tricities amongst all known planets, e=0.93 and e=0.92,
 respectively (Butler et al. 2006). Equivalently, if we re-
 strict the sample of extrasolar planets in nearly-equal-
 mass stellar binaries to modest eccentricity (e <0.8), in
 5 of the 5 known systems, the planet orbits the lowermass star. We oï¬€er several speculative possibilities to
 explain the current pattern of planets in nearly-equal-
 mass stellar binaries: 1) The pattern arises due to small
 sample statistics, 2) Planets form more readily around
 the lower mass component of a nearly-equal-mass stellar
 binary, 3) Planets form equally likely around the compo-
 nents of a nearly-equal-mass stellar binary, but planets
 orbiting the primary component have lower detectability
 due to lower planet mass or higher orbital eccentricity
 (Cumming 2004).
 The XO-2 stellar binary has a higher space ve-
 locity with respect to the Local Standard of Rest
 (LSR), v=âˆš
 U2+V2+W2âˆ¼100 kmsâˆ’1, than most
 of the other known extrasolar planets (Santos et al.
 2003; Ecuvillon et al. 2007). According to the purely
 kinematic classiï¬cation of Bensby et al. (2003) and
 Bensby et al. (2006), XO-2 has âˆ¼7 times higher proba-
 bility of belonging to the Thick Disk than the Thin Disk.
 From a chemical abundance perspective, a metallicity of
 [Fe/H] <âˆ’0.3 is typically the upper limit for Thick Disk
 metallicities (Mishenina et al. 2004; Reddy et al. 2006).
 However, Bensby et al. (2006) has recently claimed kine-
 matically selected Thick Disk stars with [Fe/H] âˆ¼0.0
 have a chemical abundance pattern distinguishable from
 Thin Disk stars at the same metallicity. The sample of
 stars with kinematics suggestive of the Thick Disk but
 Thin Disk metallicities, like XO-2, is still too small to de-
 termine their relationship to the traditional Thin/Thick
 Disk populations. However, Mishenina et al. (2004)
 distinguishes between objects with Thick Disk kine-
 matics and Thin Disk metallicity by determining the
 maximum height above the Galactic disk their orbit
 attains, Zmax. Both the estimate of Bensby et al.
 (2005) for Zmaxand integrating the orbit of XO-2 us-
 ing the axi-symmetric, static Galaxy potential model of
 Allen & Santillan (1991) yield Zmaxâˆ¼100 pc for the or-
 bit of XO-2. Given the much larger scale height for the
 Thick Disk, ÏƒTDâˆ¼1000 kpc, under the classiï¬cation of
 Mishenina et al. (2004), XO-2 belongs to the Thin Disk,
 since its orbit is well conï¬ned to the Galactic plane. The
 high space velocity of XO-2 results from high eccentric-
 ity rather than excursions from Galactic plane. Using the
 simple model from Allen & Santillan (1991), the orbit of
 XO-2 has a pericenter within âˆ¼4 kpc of the Galactic cen-
 ter and apocenter âˆ¼9 kpc (e âˆ¼0.4).
 Currently, XO-2 lags the LSR by V=âˆ’78 kmsâˆ’1and
 is moving away from the Galactic center at U=âˆ’71
 kmsâˆ’1. This places XO-2 in phase space near the Her-
 cules stream (Famaey et al. 2005; Ecuvillon et al. 2007)
 (U= 42, ÏƒU= 28, V=âˆ’52,ÏƒV= 9 kmsâˆ’1), but is
 lagging the LSR more than the typical Hercules stream
 member. The possibility that XO-2 belongs to a dynam-
 ical stream originating from the metal-rich inner Galaxy
 is an example that supports the ï¬ndings of Famaey et al.
 (2005) and Ecuvillon et al. (2007) that compared to ï¬eld
 stars, metal-enhanced dynamical streams should be over-
 abundant in detectable extrasolar planets.
 5.SUMMARY
 The star XO-2, GSC 03413-00005, hosts an approx-
 imately Jupiter-size, 0.6 Jupiter-mass transiting extra-
 solar planet, XO-2b, with an orbital period âˆ¼2.6 days.
 XO-2 is a V=11.2 early K dwarf with high metallicity,
 [Fe/H]=0.45, high proper motion, Âµtot= 157 mas yrâˆ’1,12
 and has a common proper motion stellar companion
 with 31â€²â€²separation. The followup high resolution spec-
 troscopy yields Mâ‹†=0.98Â±0.02 M âŠ™for the mass of XO-2
 andMp=0.57Â±0.06 M Jfor the mass of XO-2b. The fol-
 lowup high precision photometry yields Râ‹†=0.964 Â±0.02
 0.009
 RâŠ™for the radius of XO-2 and Rp=0.973 Â±0.03
 0.008RJfor
 the radius of XO-2b. Joint analysis of the light curve
 and spectroscopy yields an isochrone based age of XO-
 2t=5.0Â±1.0
 0.5Gyr, and an isochrone based distance to
 XO-2 d=149Â±4
 1pc. The quoted values and their un-
 certainties are Bayesian credible intervals encompassing
 68% of the marginalized posterior probability. For the
 Bayesian analysis we assume a Gaussian-like prior on
 Mâ‹†, derived from the spectroscopic and isochrone anal-
 ysis of XO-2 and uniform priors on Râ‹†,Rp, orbital in-
 clination, and limb darkening coeï¬ƒcients. We describe
 an eï¬ƒcient Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to cal-
 culate the Bayesian posterior probability for the system
 parameters from a transit light curve. System param-
 eters and conï¬dence intervals from a Ï‡2minimization
 yield the same results within the uncertainties and are
 also provided in Table 6.
 XO-2b adds to the sample of Jupiter-mass planets re-
 siding in nearly-equal-mass stellar binaries. In 5 of the
 7 nearly-equal-mass stellar binaries hosting a planet, the
 planet orbits the lower mass stellar component. In the
 remaining 2 stellar binaries where the planet orbits the
 higher mass star, the planetsâ€™ orbits are highly eccentric
 (e>0.9). Equivalently, if we restrict the sample of extra-
 solar planets with modest eccentricity (e <0.8) orbits in
 nearly-equal-mass stellar binaries, in 5 of the 5 known
 systems, the planet orbits the lower mass star. We spec-
 ulate on possible astrophysical reasons for this pattern
 beyond the simple fact that the statistics are based upon
 a very small sample and thus may be spurious.
 With its high proper motion, XO-2 has kinematics sug-
 gestive of Thick Disk membership but a Thin Disk metal-
 licity. In contrast to the typical Thick Disk member, the
 high proper motion of XO-2 results from an eccentric or-bit (Galactic pericenter, Rper<4 kpc) well conï¬ned to
 the Galactic disk, Zmaxâˆ¼100 pc. XO-2 may originate in
 the metal-rich inner Thin Disk and was dynamically scat-
 tered into the solar neighborhood. Similar to the ï¬ndings
 of Famaey et al. (2005) and Ecuvillon et al. (2007), the
 discovery of XO-2b suggests metal-enhanced dynamical
 streams from the inner Galaxy may be abundant in de-
 tectable extrasolar planets.
