 Abstract
 A general formulation was developed to represent material m odels for applications
 in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calcu late response to shock
 and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizin g previous solutions
 for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were fo und to be ï¬‚exible and
 robust, and matched analytic results to a high accuracy. The basic ramp and shock
 solution methods were coupled to solve for composite deform ation paths, such as
 shock-induced impacts, and shock interactions with a plana r interface between dif-
 ferent materials. These calculations capture much of the ph ysics of typical material
 dynamics experiments, without requiring spatially-resol ving simulations. Example
 calculations were made of loading histories in Be and Mo, ill ustrating the eï¬€ects
 of plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentr opic and shock-release
 experiments.

 1 Introduction
 The continuum representation of matter is widely used for ma terial dynamics
 in science and engineering. Spatially-resolved continuum dynamics simulations
 are the most widespread and familiar, solving the initial va lue problem by dis-
 cretizing the spatial domain and integrating the dynamical equations forward
 in time to predict the motion and deformation of components o f the system.

 Preprint submitted to Elsevier March 7, 2007 â€“ LA-UR-07-205 1This type of simulation is used, for instance, to study hyper velocity impact
 problems such as the vulnerability of armor to projectiles [ 1,2], the perfor-
 mance of satellite debris shields [3], and the impact of mete orites with plan-
 ets, notably the formation of the moon [4]. The problem can be divided into
 the dynamical equations of the continuum, the state ï¬eld of t he components
 s(/vector r), and the inherent properties of the materials. Given the lo cal material
 states, the material properties allow the stress Ï„to be determined. Given the
 stress ï¬eld Ï„(/vector r) and mass density ï¬eld Ï(/vector r), the dynamical equations describe
 the ï¬elds of acceleration, compression, and thermodynamic work done on the
 materials.
 The equations of continuum dynamics describe the behavior o f a dynami-
 cally deforming system of arbitrary complexity. Particula r, simpler deforma-
 tion paths can be described more compactly by diï¬€erent sets o f equations,
 and solved by diï¬€erent techniques than those used for contin uum dynamics
 in general. Simpler deformation paths occur often in experi ments designed
 to develop and calibrate models of material properties. The se paths can be
 regarded as diï¬€erent ways of interrogating the material pro perties. The princi-
 pal examples in material dynamics are shock and ramp compres sion. Typical
 experiments are designed to induce such loading histories a nd measure or in-
 fer the properties of the material in these states before the y are destroyed by
 reï¬‚ected waves.
 The development of the ï¬eld of material dynamics was driven b y applications
 in the physics of hypervelocity impact and high explosive sy stems, including
 nuclear weapons [5]. In the regimes of interest, typically c omponents with
 dimensions ranging from millimeters to meters and pressure s from 1GPa to
 1TPa, material behavior is dominated by the scalar equation of state (EOS):
 the relationship between pressure, compression (or mass de nsity), and inter-
 nal energy. Other components of stress (speciï¬cally shear s tresses) are much
 smaller, and chemical explosives react promptly so can be tr eated by simple
 models of complete detonation. EOS were developed as ï¬ts to e xperimen-
 tal data, particularly to series of shock states and to isoth ermal compression
 measurements [6]. It is relatively straightforward to cons truct shock and ramp
 compression states from an EOS algebraically or numericall y depending on
 the EOS, and to ï¬t an EOS to these measurements. More recently , applica-
 tions and scientiï¬c interest have grown to include a wider ra nge of pressures
 and time scales, such as laser-driven inertial conï¬nement f usion [7], and ex-
 periments are designed to measure other aspects than the EOS , such as the
 kinetics of phase changes, constitutive behavior describi ng shear stresses, in-
 complete chemical reactions, and the eï¬€ects of microstruct ure such as grain
 orientation and porosity. Theoretical techniques have als o evolved to predict
 the EOS with âˆ¼1% accuracy [8] and elastic contributions to shear stress wi th
 slightly poorer accuracy [9].
 2In this paper, a general convention for representing materi al states is described,
 and numerical methods are reported for calculating shock an d ramp compres-
 sion states from general representations of material prope rties.
 2 Conceptual structure for material properties
 The desired structure for the description of the material st ate and properties
 under dynamic loading was developed to be as general as possi ble with respect
 to the types of material or models to be represented in the sam e framework,
 and designed from the greatest amount of commonality betwee n spatially-
 resolved simulations and calculations of shock and ramp com pressions.
 In condensed matter on sub-microsecond time scales, heat co nduction is often
 too slow to have a signiï¬cant eï¬€ect on the response of the mate rial, and
 is ignored here. The equations of non-relativistic continu um dynamics are,
 in Lagrangian form i.e. along characteristics moving with t he local material
 velocity /vector u(/vector r),
 DÏ(/vector r, t)
 Dt=âˆ’Ï(/vector r, t)div/vector u(/vector r, t) (1)
 D/vector u(/vector r, t)
 Dt=âˆ’1
 Ï(/vector r, t)divÏ„(/vector r, t) (2)
 De(/vector r, t)
 Dt=âˆ’||Ï„(/vector r, t)grad/vector u(/vector r, t)|| (3)
 where Ïis the mass density and ethe speciï¬c internal energy. Changes in e
 can be related to changes in the temperature Tthrough the heat capacity.
 The inherent properties of each material in the problem are d escribed by
 its constitutive relation or equation of state Ï„(s). As well as experiencing
 compression and work from mechanical deformation, the loca l material state
 s(/vector r, t) can evolve through internal processes such as plastic ï¬‚ow. In general,
 Ds(/vector r, t)
 Dtâ‰¡Ë™s[s(/vector r, t), U(/vector r, t)] : Uâ‰¡grad/vector u(/vector r, t) (4)
 which can also include the equations for âˆ‚Ï/âˆ‚t andâˆ‚e/âˆ‚t. Thus the mate-
 rial properties must describe at a minimum Ï„(s) and Ë™ s[s(/vector r, t), U(/vector r, t)] for each
 material. If they also describe T(s), the conductivity, and Ë™ s(Ë™e), then heat
 conduction can be treated. Other functions may be needed for particular nu-
 merical methods in continuum dynamics, such as the need for w ave speeds
 (e.g. the longitudinal sound speed), which are needed for ti me step control in
 explicit time integration. Internally, within the materia l properties models, it
 3is desirable to re-use software as much as possible, and othe r functions of the
 state are therefore desirable to allow models to be construc ted in a modular
 and hierarchical way. Inevitably, arithmetic manipulatio ns must be performed
 on the state, which can be encoded neatly using operator over loading. For
 instance, if Ë™ sis calculated in a forward-time numerical method then chang es
 of state are calculated using numerical evolution equation s such as
 s(t+Î´t) =s(t) +Î´tË™s. (5)
 Thus for a general state s, it is necessary to multiply it by a real number
 and to add two states together. For a speciï¬c software implem entation, other
 operations may be needed, for example to create, copy, or des troy a new
 instance of a state.
 A very wide range of types of material behavior can be represe nted with this
 formalism. At the highest level, diï¬€erent types of behavior are characterized
 by diï¬€erent structures for the state s(Table 1. For each type of state, diï¬€erent
 speciï¬c models can be deï¬ned, such as perfect gas and GrÂ¨ unei sen EOS. For
 each speciï¬c model, diï¬€erent materials are represented by c hoosing diï¬€erent
 values for the parameters in the model, and diï¬€erent local ma terial states are
 represented through diï¬€erent values for the components of s. In the jargon
 object-oriented programming, this is polymorphism. State s or models may
 be deï¬ned by extending or combining other states or models â€“ t his can be
 implemented using the object-oriented programming concep t of inheritance.
 Trial implementations have been made as libraries in the C++ and Java pro-
 gramming languages. The external interface to the material properties was
 general at the level of representing a generic material type and state. The
 type of state and model were then selected when programs usin g the material
 properties library were run. In C++, objects which were poly morphic at run
 time had to be represented as pointers, requiring additiona l software construc-
 tions to allocate and free up physical memory associated wit h each object. It
 was possible to include general re-usable functions as poly morphic objects
 when deï¬ning models: real functions of one real parameter co uld be polyno-
 mials, transcendentals, tabular with diï¬€erent interpolat ion schemes, piecewise
 deï¬nitions over diï¬€erent regions of the one dimensional lin e, sums, products,
 etc; again deï¬ned speciï¬cally at run time. Object-oriented polymorphism and
 inheritance were thus very powerful techniques for increas ing software re-use,
 making the software more compact and more reliable through t he possibility
 of using functions which had already been tested.
 Given conceptual and software structures designed to repre sent general ma-
 terial properties suitable for use in spatially-resolved c ontinuum dynamics
 simulations, we now consider the use of these generic materi al models for
 calculating ramp and shock compression.

 Gas-phase reaction can be represented as a homogeneous mixt ure, reactions trans-
 ferring mass between components representing diï¬€erent typ es of molecule. Symmet-
 ric tensors such as the stress deviator are represented more compactly by their 6
 unique upper triangular components, e.g. using Voigt notat ion.
 3 Ramp compression
 Ramp compression is taken here to mean compression or decomp ression. If
 the material is represented by a scalar EOS, i.e. ignoring an y eï¬€ects of plastic
 ï¬‚ow, ramp compression follows an isentrope. This is no longe r true when
 dissipative processes such as plastic heating occur. The te rm â€˜quasi-isentropicâ€™
 is sometimes used in this context, particularly for shockle ss compression; here
 we prefer to refer to the thermodynamic trajectories as adia bats since this is
 a more appropriate term: no heat is exchanged with the surrou ndings on the
 time scales of interest.
 For adiabatic compression, the state evolves according to t he second law of
 thermodynamics,

 The velocity gradient was expressed through a compression f actorÎ·â‰¡Ïâ€²/rho
 and a strain rate Ë™ Ç«. In all ramp experiments used in the development and cal-
 ibration of accurate material models, the strain has been ap plied uniaxially.
 More general strain paths, for instance isotropic or includ ing a shear compo-
 nent, can be treated by the same formalism, and that the heati ng rate would
 then be a full inner product of the stress and strain tensors.

 As with continuum dynamics, internal evolution of the mater ial state can
 be calculated simultaneously with the continuum equations , or operator split
 and calculated periodically at constant compression. The r esults are the same
 to second order in the compression increment. Operator-spl itting is desirable
 when internal evolution can produce highly nonlinear chang es, such as reaction
 from solid to gas: rapid changes in state and properties can m ake numerical
 schemes unstable. Operator-splitting is also desirable wh en the integration
 time step for internal evolution is much shorter than the con tinuum dynamics
 time step. Neither of these considerations is very importan t for ramp compres-
 sion without spatial resolution, but operator-splitting w as used as an option in
 the ramp compression calculations for consistency with con tinuum dynamics
 simulations.
 The ramp compression equations were integrated using forwa rd-time Runge-
 Kutta numerical schemes of second order. The fourth order sc heme is a trivial
 extension. The sequence of operations to calculate an incre ment of ramp com-
 pression is as follows:

 tË™si(s(tâ€²),Ë™Ç«)dtâ€²(14)
 where Ë™ smis the model-dependent state evolution from applied strain , and Ë™ si
 is internal evolution at constant compression.
 The independent variable for integration is speciï¬c volume vor mass density
 Ï; for numerical integration ï¬nite steps are taken in Ïandv. The step size
 âˆ†Ïcan be controlled so that the numerical error during integra tion remains
 within chosen limits. A tabular adiabat can be calculated by integrating over a
 range of vorÏ, but when simulating experimental scenarios the upper limi t for
 integration is usually that one of the other thermodynamic q uantities reaches
 a certain value, for example that the normal component of str ess reaches
 zero, which is the case on release from a high pressure state a t a free surface.
 Speciï¬c stop conditions were found by monitoring the quanti ty of interest until
 bracketed by a ï¬nite integration step, then bisecting until the stop condition
 was satisï¬ed to a chosen accuracy. During bisection, each tr ial calculation was
 performed as an integration from the ï¬rst side of the bracket by the trial
 compression.
 4 Shock compression
 Shock compression is the solution of a Riemann problem for th e dynamics
 of a jump in compression moving with constant speed and with a constant
 thickness. The Rankine-Hugoniot (RH) equations [10] descr ibing the shock
 compression of matter are derived in the continuum approxim ation, where
 the shock is a formal discontinuity in the continuum ï¬elds. I n reality, matter
 is composed of atoms, and shocks have a ï¬nite width governed b y the kinetics
 7of dissipative processes â€“ at a fundamental level, matter do es not distinguish
 between shock compression and ramp compression with a high s train rate â€“
 but the RH equations apply as long as the width of the region of matter where
 unresolved processes occur is constant. Compared with the i sentropic states
 induced by ramp compression in a material represented by an E OS, a shock
 always increases the entropy and hence the temperature. Wit h dissipative
 processes included, the distinction between a ramp and a sho ck may become
 blurred.
 The RH equations express the conservation of mass, momentum , and energy
 across a moving discontinuity in state. They are usually exp ressed in terms of
 the pressure, but are readily generalized for materials sup porting shear stresses
 by using the component of stress normal to the shock (i.e., pa rallel with the
 direction of propagation of the shock), Ï„n:

 where usis the speed of the shock wave with respect to the material, âˆ† upis
 the change in material speed normal to the shock wave (i.e., p arallel to its
 direction of propagation), and subscript 0 refers to the ini tial state.
 The RH relations can be applied to general material models if a time scale
 or strain rate is imposed, and an orientation chosen for the m aterial with
 respect to the shock. Shock compression in continuum dynami cs is almost
 always uniaxial.
 The RH equations involve only the initial and ï¬nal states in t he material. If a
 material has properties that depend on the deformation path â€“ such as plas-
 tic ï¬‚ow or viscosity â€“ then physically the detailed shock str ucture may make
 a diï¬€erence [13]. This is a limitation of discontinuous shoc ks in continuum
 dynamics: it may be addressed as discussed above by includin g dissipative
 processes and considering ramp compression, if the dissipa tive processes can
 be represented adequately in the continuum approximation. Spatially-resolved
 simulations with numerical diï¬€erentiation to obtain spati al derivatives and for-
 ward time diï¬€erencing are usually not capable of representi ng shock disconti-
 nuities directly, and an artiï¬cial viscosity is used to smea r shock compression
 over a few spatial cells [14]. The trajectory followed by the material in ther-
 modynamic space is a smooth adiabat with dissipative heatin g supplied by
 the artiï¬cial viscosity. If plastic work is also included du ring this adiabatic
 compression, the overall heating for a given compression is greater than from
 the RH equations. To be consistent, plastic ï¬‚ow should be neg lected while
 8the artiï¬cial viscosity is non-zero. This localized disabl ing of physical pro-
 cesses, particularly time-dependent ones, during the pass age of the unphys-
 ically smeared shock was previously found necessary for num erically stable
 simulations of detonation waves by reactive ï¬‚ow [15].
 Detonation waves are reactive shock waves. Steady planar de tonation (the
 Chapman-Jouguet state [16]) may be calculated using the RH r elations, by
 imposing the condition that the material state behind the sh ock is fully re-
 acted.
 Several numerical methods have been used to solve the RH equa tions for
 materials represented by an EOS only [11,12]. The general RH equations may
 be solved numerically for a given shock compression âˆ† Ïby varying the speciï¬c
 internal energy euntil the normal stress from the material model equals that
 from the RH energy equation, Eq. 17. The shock and particle sp eeds are
 then calculated from Eqs 15 and 16. This numerical method is p articularly
 convenient for EOS of the form p(Ï, e), asemay be varied directly. Solutions
 may still be found for general material models using Ë™ s(Ë™e), by which the energy
 may be varied until the solution is found.
 Numerically, the solution was found by bracketing and bisec tion:
 (1) For given compression âˆ† Ï, take the low-energy end for bracketing as a
 nearby state sâˆ’(e.g. the previous state, of lower compression, on the
 Hugoniot), compressed adiabatically (to state Ëœ s), and cooled so the spe-
 ciï¬c internal energy is e(sâˆ’).
 (2) Bracket the desired state: apply successively larger he ating increments
 âˆ†eto Ëœs, evolving each trial state internally, until Ï„n(s) from the material
 model exceeds Ï„n(eâˆ’e0) from Eq. 17.
 (3) Bisect in âˆ† e, evolving each trial state internally, until Ï„n(s) equals Ï„n(eâˆ’
 e0) to the desired accuracy.
 As with ramp compression, the independent variable for solu tion was mass
 density Ï, and ï¬nite steps âˆ† Ïwere taken. Each shock state was calculated
 independently of the rest, so numerical errors did not accum ulate along the
 shock Hugoniot. The accuracy of the solution was independen t of âˆ† Ï. A tab-
 ular Hugoniot can be calculated by solving over a range of Ï, but again when
 simulating experimental scenarios it is usually more usefu l to calculate the
 shock state where one of the other thermodynamic quantities reaches a cer-
 tain value, often that upandÏ„nmatch the values from another, simultaneous
 shock calculation for another material â€“ the situation in im pact and shock
 transmission problems, discussed below. Speciï¬c stop cond itions were found
 by monitoring the quantity of interest until bracketed by a ï¬ nite solution step,
 then bisecting until the stop condition was satisï¬ed to a cho sen accuracy. Dur-
 ing bisection, each trial calculation was performed as a sho ck from the initial
 9conditions to the trial shock compression.
 5 Composite loading paths
 Given methods to calculate shock and adiabatic loading path s from arbitrary
 initial states, a considerable variety of experimental sce narios can be treated
 from the interaction of loading or unloading waves with inte rfaces between dif-
 ferent materials, in planar geometry for uniaxial compress ion. The key physical
 constraint is that, if two dissimilar materials are to remai n in contact after an
 interaction such as an impact or the passage of a shock, the no rmal stress Ï„n
 and particle speed upin both materials must be equal on either side of the
 interface. The change in particle speed and stress normal to the waves were
 calculated above for compression waves running in the direc tion of increasing
 spatial ordinate (left to right). Across an interface, the s ense is reversed for
 the material at the left. Thus a projectile impacting a stati onary target to the
 right is decelerated from its initial speed by the shock indu ced by impact.
 The general problem at an interface can be analyzed by consid ering the
 states at the instant of ï¬rst contact â€“ on impact, or when a sho ck travel-
 ing through a sandwich of materials ï¬rst reaches the interfa ce. The initial
 states are {ul, sl;ur, sr}. The ï¬nal states are {uj, sâ€²
 l;uj, râ€²
 r}where ujis the
 joint particle speed, Ï„n(sâ€²
 l) =Ï„n(sâ€²
 r), and sâ€²
 iis connected to siby either a shock
 or an adiabat, starting at the appropriate initial velocity and stress, and with
 orientation given by the side of the system each material occ urs on. Each type
 of wave is considered in turn, looking for an intersection in theupâˆ’Ï„nplane.
 Examples of these wave interactions are the impact of a proje ctile with a sta-
 tionary target (Fig. 1), release of a shock state at a free sur face or a material
 (e.g. a window) of lower shock impedance (hence reï¬‚ecting a r elease wave
 into the shocked material â€“ Fig. 2), reshocking at a surface w ith a material of
 higher shock impedance (Fig. 2), or tension induced as mater ials try to sepa-
 rate in opposite directions when joined by a bonded interfac e (Fig. 3). Each of
 these scenarios may occur in turn following the impact of a pr ojectile with a
 target: if the target is layered then a shock is transmitted a cross each interface
 with a release or a reshock reï¬‚ected back, depending on the ma terials; release
 ultimately occurs at the rear of the projectile and the far en d of the target,
 and the oppositely-moving release waves subject the projec tile and target to
 tensile stresses when they interact (Fig. 4).
 An extension of this analysis can be used to calculate the int eraction of oblique
 shocks with an interface [17].

 Material damage, spall, and separation are neglected: the c onstruction shows the

 where Gis the shear modulus and Ë™ Ç«the strain rate deviator. Thus the isotropic

 GtoGâ€², leaves Ç«unchanged), then shear unloading to isotropic stress, the
 true unloading strain is âˆ’Ç«, whereas the hypoelastic calculation would require
 a strain of âˆ’Ç«G/Gâ€².
 The stress can be considered as a direct response of the mater ial to the instan-
 taneous state of elastic strain: Ïƒ(Ç«, T). This relation can be predicted directly
 with electronic structure calculations of the stress tenso r in a solid for a given
 compression and elastic strain state [9], and is a direct gen eralization of the
 scalar equation of state. A more consistent representation of the state param-
 eters is to use the strain deviator Ç«rather than Ïƒ, and to calculate Ïƒfrom
 scratch when required using
 Ïƒ=G(s)Ç« (19)

 lation is correct. If the shear modulus varies with strain de viator â€“ i.e., for
 nonlinear elasticity â€“ then the deï¬nition of G(Ç«) must be adjusted to give the
 same stress for a given strain.
 13Many isotropic strength models use scalar measures of the st rain and stress
 to parameterize work hardening and to apply a yield model of ï¬‚ ow stress:
 ËœÇ«=/radicalBig
 fÇ«||Ç«2||,ËœÏƒ=/radicalBig
 fÏƒ||Ïƒ2||. (20)
 Inconsistent conventions for equivalent scalar measures h ave been used by
 diï¬€erent workers. In the present work, the common shock phys ics convention
 was used that the ï¬‚ow stress component of Ï„nis2
 3Ywhere Yis the ï¬‚ow stress.
 For consistency with published speeds and amplitudes for el astic waves, fÇ«=
 fÏƒ=3
 2, in contrast to other values previously used for lower-rate deformation
 [19]. In principle, the values of fÇ«andfÏƒdo not matter as long as the strength
 parameters were calibrated using the same values then used i n any simulations.
 7 Examples
 In this section, the numerical methods described above are a pplied to example
 materials, demonstrating the eï¬€ects of strength and chemic al reaction on the
 loading paths. The materials chosen were air represented by a perfect gas EOS,
 the elemental metals Be and Mo. The perfect gas case tests the numerical
 schemes against analytic results. Be has been shown to exhib it relatively high
 ï¬‚ow stresses for deformation on the nanosecond time scales o f interest for
 its application as the fuel capsule and ablator in inertial c onï¬nement fusion
 [20]. Mo is interesting as experimental measurements sugge st that its shock
 temperature is signiï¬cantly greater than expected using th e EOS only [21].
 7.1 Air
 Air was chosen as an example of matter represented by the scal ar EOS only,
 taken here to be the perfect gas EOS,
 p= (Î³âˆ’1)Ïe, (21)
 withÎ³= 1.4. Air at standard temperature and pressure has approximate ly

 p= (Î³âˆ’1)2e0Ï0Ï+p0(Ïâˆ’Ï0)

 The numerical methods above reproduced the principal isent rope and Hugo-
 niot to 10âˆ’3% and 0.1% respectively, for a compression increment of 1% al ong
 the isentrope and a solution tolerance of 10âˆ’6GPa for each shock state (Fig. 5).
 Over most of the range, the error in the Hugoniot was 0.02% or l ess, only ap-
 proaching 0.1% near the maximum shock compression.
 157.2 Complete equation of state for metals
 Empirical EOS for Be and Mo have been published [22] that were ï¬tted
 to shock data acquired from microsecond scale impact experi ments. This
 GrÂ¨ uneisen EOS had the form p(Ï, e), so the temperature Twas not directly
 available. Temperatures were calculated by reference to a c ompression curve
 along which the temperature and speciï¬c internal energy wer e known, {Tr, er}(Ï),
 and using a speciï¬c heat capacity deï¬ned as a function of dens itycv(Ï) (con-
 stant in practice). The reference curve chosen was the zero k elvin isotherm
 (â€˜cold curveâ€™), Tr= 0K. This was calculated from the principal isentrope
 e(Ï)|s0using the estimated density variation of GrÂ¨ uneisen parame ter:
 er(Ï) =e(Ï)|s0âˆ’T0cpea(1âˆ’Ï0/Ï)/parenleftBiggÏ
 Ï0/parenrightBiggÎ³0âˆ’a
 . (24)
 In the calculations, this augmented EOS was represented as a â€˜mechanical-
 thermalâ€™ form comprising any p(Ï, e) EOS plus the reference curves â€“ an ex-
 ample of inheritance and polymorphism.
 Empirical EOS are calibrated using experimental data. Shoc k and adiabatic
 compression measurements on strong materials inevitably i nclude elastic-plastic
 contributions as well as the scalar EOS itself. If the elasti c-plastic contributions
 are not taken into account self-consistently, the EOS may im plicitly include
 contributions from the strength. A unique scalar EOS can be c onstructed to
 reproduce the normal stress as a function of compression for any unique load-
 ing path: shock or adiabat, for a constant or smoothly-varyi ng strain rate.
 Such as EOS would not generally predict the normal stress for other load-
 ing histories. The GrÂ¨ uneisen EOS and Steinberg-Guinan str ength model for
 the materials discussed below were constructed self-consi stently from shock
 data â€“ this does not mean the models are accurate for other loa ding paths, as
 neither the EOS nor the strength model includes all the physi cal terms that
 real materials exhibit. This does not in any case matter for t he purposes of
 demonstrating the properties of the numerical schemes.
 7.3 Beryllium
 The ï¬‚ow stress measured from laser-driven shock experiment s on Be crystals
 a few tens of micrometers thick is, at around 5-9GPa, much gre ater than the
 0.3-1.3GPa measured on microsecond time scales. A time-dep endent crystal
 plasticity model for Be is being developed, and the behavior under dynamic
 loading depends on the detailed time dependence of plastici ty. Calculations
 were performed with the Steinberg-Guinan strength model de veloped for mi-

 crosecond scale data [22], and, for the purposes of rough com parison, with
 elastic-perfectly plastic response with a ï¬‚ow stress of 10G Pa. The elastic-
 perfectly plastic model neglected pressure and work harden ing.
 Calculations were made of the principal adiabat and shock Hu goniot, and of
 a release adiabat from a state on the principal Hugoniot. Cal culations were
 made with and without strength. Considering the state traje ctories in stress-
 volume space, it is interesting to note that heating from pla stic ï¬‚ow may push
 the adiabat above the Hugoniot, because of the greater heati ng obtained by
 integrating along the adiabat compared with jumping from th e initial to the
 ï¬nal state on the Hugoniot (Fig. 6). Even with an elastic-per fectly plastic
 strength model, the with-strength curves do not lie exactly2
 3Yabove the
 strengthless curves, because heating from plastic ï¬‚ow cont ributes an increasing
 amount of internal energy to the EOS as compression increase s.
 An important characteristic for the seeding of instabiliti es by microstructural
 variations in shock response is the shock stress at which an e lastic wave does
 not run ahead of the shock. In Be with the high ï¬‚ow stress of nan osecond
 response, the relation between shock and particle speeds is signiï¬cantly dif-
 ferent from the relation for low ï¬‚ow stress (Fig. 7). For low ï¬‚ ow stress, the
 elastic wave travels at 13.2km/s. A plastic shock travels fa ster than this for
 pressures greater than 110GPa, independent of the constitu tive model. The
 speed of a plastic shock following the initial elastic wave i s similar to the low
 strength case, because the material is already at its ï¬‚ow str ess, but the speed
 of a single plastic shock is appreciably higher.

 higher with plastic ï¬‚ow included. The additional heating is particularly strik-
 ing on the principal adiabat: the temperature departs signi ï¬cantly from the
 principal isentrope. Thus ramp-wave compression of strong materials may lead
 to signiï¬cant levels of heating, contrary to common assumpt ions of small tem-
 perature increases [23]. Plastic ï¬‚ow is largely irreversib le, so heating occurs
 on unloading as well as loading. Thus, on adiabatic release f rom a shock-
 compressed state, additional heating occurs compared with the no-strength
 case. These levels of heating are important as shock or relea se melting may
 occur at a signiï¬cantly lower shock pressure than would be ex pected ignoring
 the eï¬€ect of strength. (Fig. 8.)
 7.4 Molybdenum
 Experiments have been reported in which samples of Mo were su bjected to
 shock loading on microsecond time scales by projectile impa ct, and the tem-
 perature in the shocked state was measured by neutron resona nce spectrome-
 try [21]. The temperature measured was around 200K greater t han predicted
 using EOS that are thought to be accurate to a few percent.
 The principal shock Hugoniot of Mo was calculated using mate rial properties
 previously published [22], with parameters for the Steinbe rg-Guinan strength
 model [24], which includes work-hardening, pressure-hard ening, and thermal
 softening eï¬€ects. The shock Hugoniot with strength lay at a s igniï¬cantly
 higher temperature than the calculation ignoring strength , which matched
 the previously-reported shock Hugoniot (Fig. 9). The tempe rature diï¬€erence

 a signiï¬cant contribution to the discrepancy, but not all. T he complete ex-
 planation involves non-idealities in the projectile accel erating system, and is
 discussed elsewhere [25].
 198 Conclusions
 A general formulation was developed to represent material m odels for appli-
 cations in dynamic loading, suitable for software implemen tation in object-
 oriented programming languages. Numerical methods were de vised to calcu-
 late the response of matter represented by the general mater ial models to
 shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, by dire ct evaluation
 of the thermodynamic pathways for these compressions rathe r than spatially-
 resolved simulations. This approach is a generalization of earlier work on so-
 lutions for materials represented by a scalar equation of st ate. The numerical
 methods were found to be ï¬‚exible and robust: capable of appli cation to mate-
 rials with very diï¬€erent properties. The numerical solutio ns matched analytic
 results to a high accuracy.
 Care was needed with the interpretation of some types of phys ical response,
 such as plastic ï¬‚ow, when applied to deformation at high stra in rates. The
 underlying time-dependence of processes occurring during deformation should
 be taken into account. The actual history of loading and heat ing experienced
 by material during the passage of a shock may inï¬‚uence the ï¬na l state â€“ this
 history is not captured in the continuum approximation to ma terial dynamics,
 where shocks are treated as discontinuities. Thus care is al so needed in spa-
 tially resolved simulations when shocks are modeled using a rtiï¬cial viscosity
 to smear them unphysically over a ï¬nite thickness.
 The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to sol ve for compos-
 ite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and s hock interactions
 with a planar interface between diï¬€erent materials. Such ca lculations capture
 much of the physics of typical material dynamics experiment s, without requir-
 ing spatially-resolving simulations.
 Example calculations were made of loading histories in Be an d Mo, illustrating
 the eï¬€ects of plastic work on the temperatures induced in qua si-isentropic and
 shock-release experiments.
