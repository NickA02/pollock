 Abstract 
 The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field fluid 
 model proposed in the Meeting of Division of  Particle and Field 2004, American Physical 
 Society. The current behavior of  the Earth-Moon system agrees  with this m odel very well 
 and the general pattern of the evolution of  the Moon-Earth system described by this 
 model agrees with geological and fossil evid ence. The closest distance of the Moon to 
 Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5 billion years ago, which is far beyond the Rocheâ€™s 
 limit. The result suggests that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the 
 evolution of the Earth-Moon system. The averag e dark matter field fluid constant derived 
 from Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 Ã— 10-22 s-1m-1. This model predicts that the Marsâ€™s 
 rotation is also slowing with the an gular acceleration rate about -4.38 Ã— 10-22 rad s-2. 
  
 1. Introduction 
 The popularly accepted theory for the forma tion of the Earth-Moon system is that 
 the Moon was formed from debris of a strong impact by a giant planetesimal with the 
 Earth at the close of the planet-forming period (Hartmann and Davis 1975). Since the formation of the Earth-Moon system, it has been  evolving at all tim e scale. It is well 
 known that the Moon is receding from us and both the Earthâ€™s rotation and Moonâ€™s rotation are slowing. The popular th eory is that the tidal fric tion causes all those changes. 
 However, based on tidal friction model and the current Moon-Earth system data, the tidal 
 friction should be stronger and the recessiona l rate of the Moon should be greater in the 
 past because the Moon was closer, the distance of the Moon would quickly fall inside the 
 Roche's limit (for earth, 15500 km) in which the Moon would be torn apart by gravity in 
  11 to 2 billion years ago. This, however, never happened. Furthermore, geological 
 evidence indicates that the reces sion of the Moon in the past was slower than the present 
 rate, i. e., the recession has been accelerating with time. Based on tidal friction models, it must be concluded that tidal friction was ve ry much less in the remote past than we 
 would deduce on the basis of present-day observations (S tacey 1977).  This was called 
 â€œgeological time scale difficultyâ€ or â€œLunar cr isisâ€ and is one of main arguments by 
 creationists against the tidal friction theory (Brush 1983). Various models were proposed 
 in the past to describe the evolution of the Earth-Moon system based on tidal friction mechanism to avoid this difficulty and put th e Moon at quite a comfortable distance from 
 Earth at 4.5 billion years ago (Hansen 1982, Kagan and Maslova 1994, Ray  et al. 1999, 
 Slichter 1963). The tidal friction theories explain that the present rate of tidal dissipation 
 is anomalously high because the tidal force is close to a resona nce in the response 
 function of ocean (Brush 1983).
  Kagan gave a detailed review  about those tidal friction 
 models (Kagan 1997). However, all those m odels are based on many assumptions about 
 geological (continental position and drifting) and physical conditions  in the past, and 
 many parameters (such as phase lag angle, multi-mode approximation with time-dependent frequencies of the resonance modes, etc.) have to be introduced and carefully 
 adjusted to make their predictions close to the geological evidence. Therefore, they are 
 not so convincing, and are still challenged by cr eationists. In the Meeting of Division of 
 Particle and Field 2004, American Physical  Society, University  of California at 
 Riverside, the author proposed a dark matte r field fluid model (Pan 2005), the current 
 Moon and Earth data agree with this model very  well. This paper will demonstrate that   
 the past evolution of Moon-Earth system can be described by the da rk matter field fluid 
 model without any assumptions about past geological and physical  conditions. Although 
 the subject of the evolution of the Earth-Moon system has been extensively studied analytically or numerically, to the authorâ€™s  knowledge, there are no theories similar or 
 equivalent to this model. It should be noted  that the proposed dark matter field fluid is 
 more like the cosmic fluid in distinguishing to the galactic halo or clump type of the dark 
 matter in current cosmological theories. 
  
  22. The dark matter field fluid model 
 In this proposed model, it is assumed that: 
 1.  A celestial body rotates and moves in the space, which, for simplicity, is uniformly 
 filled with the dark matter which is in qui escent state relative to the motion of the 
 celestial body. The dark matter possesses a fi eld property and a fluid property; it can 
 interact with the celestial body w ith its fluid and fiel d properties; theref ore, it can have 
 energy exchange with the celestial body, and affect the motion of the celestial body. 
 2.  The fluid property follows the general prin ciple of fluid mechanics. The dark matter 
 field fluid particles may be so small that they can easily permeate into ordinary â€œbaryonicâ€ matter;  i. e., ordina ry matter objects could be satu rated with such dark matter 
 field fluid. Thus, the whole celestial body intera cts with the dark matter field fluid, in the 
 manner of a sponge moving thru water. The natu re of the field propert y of the dark matter 
 field fluid is unknown. It is here assumed that the interaction of the field associated with 
 the dark matter field fluid with the celes tial body is proportional to the mass of the 
 celestial body. The dark matter fiel d fluid is assumed to have a repulsive force against the 
 gravitational force towards baryonic matter. Th e nature and mechanism of such repulsive 
 force is unknown. 
 With the assumptions above, one can study how the dark matter field fluid may 
 influence the motion of a cel estial body and compare the results with observations. The 
 common shape of celestial bodies  is spherical. According to  Stokes's law, a rigid non-
 permeable sphere moving through a quiescent  fluid with a sufficiently low Reynolds 
 number experiences a resistance force F 
 rv FÏ€Î¼6âˆ’ =       ( 1 )  
 where v is the moving velocity, r is the radius of the sphere, and Î¼ is the fluid viscosity 
 constant. The direction of the resistance forc e in equation (1) is opposite to the direction 
 of the velocity. For a rigid sphere moving through the dark matter field fluid, due to the 
 dual properties of the dark matter field fluid and its permeation into the sphere, the force F may not be proportional to th e radius of the sphere. Also, F may be proportional to the 
 mass of the sphere due to the field interacti on. Therefore, with the combined effects of 
  3both fluid and field, the force exerted on the sphere by the dark matter field fluid is 
 assumed to be of the scaled form 
         ( 2 )  mv r Fnâˆ’âˆ’ =16Ï€Î·
 where n is a parameter arising from saturation by dark matter field fluid, the r1-n can be 
 viewed as the effective radius with the same unit as r, m is the mass of the sphere, and Î· 
 is the dark matter field fluid c onstant, which is equivalent to Î¼. The direction of the force 
 in equation (2) is opposite to th e velocity. The force described by equation (2) is velocity-
 dependent and causes negativ e acceleration. According to  Newton's second law of 
 motion, the equation of mo tion for the sphere is 
    mv rdtdvmnâˆ’âˆ’ =16Ï€Î·      ( 3 )  
 Then  
         ( 4 )  ) 6 exp(1
 0 t r v vnâˆ’âˆ’ =Ï€Î·
 where v0 is the initial velocity ( t = 0) of the sphere. If th e sphere revolves around a 
 massive gravitational center, ther e are three forces in the lin e between the sphere and the 
 gravitational center: (1) the gravitational for ce, (2) the centripetal acceleration force; and 
 (3) the repulsive force of the dark matter fi eld fluid.  The drag force in equation (3) 
 reduces the orbital velocity and causes the sphere to move inward to the gravitational 
 center. However, if the sum of the centripetal acceleration force and the repulsive force is stronger than the gravitational force, then, the sphere will move outward and recede from 
 the gravitational center. This is the case of interest here. If the velocity change in equation (3) is sufficiently slow and the re pulsive force is small compared to the 
 gravitational force and centripetal accelerati on force, then the rate of receding will be 
 accordingly relatively slow. Therefore, th e gravitational force and the centripetal 
 acceleration force can be approximately treate d in equilibrium at any time. The pseudo 
 equilibrium equation is 
 Rmv
 RGMm2
 2=       ( 5 )  
 where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the gravitational center, and R is 
 the radius of the orbit.  Inserting v of equation (4) into equation (5) yields  
  4   ) 12 exp(1

 vGMRnâˆ’= Ï€Î·     (6) 
 or 
        (7) ) 12 exp(1
 0 t r R Rnâˆ’= Ï€Î·
 where 
    2
 00vGMR=       ( 8 )  
 R0 is the initial distance to the gravitational center.  Note that R exponentially increases 
 with time. The increase of orbital energy with the receding comes from the repulsive 
 force of dark matter field fluid.  Th e recessional rate of the sphere is 
 R rdtdRnâˆ’=112Ï€Î·      ( 9 )  
 The acceleration of the recession is 
    ( R r
 dtR dn21
 22
 12âˆ’=Ï€Î·).     (10) 
 The recessional acceleration is positive and proportional to its distance to the 
 gravitational center, so the r ecession is faster and faster. 
 According to the mechanics of fluids, for a rigid non-permeable sphere rotating 
 about its central axis in the quiescent fluid, the torque T exerted by the fluid on the sphere 
 is 
 Ï‰ Ï€Î¼38r Tâˆ’ =       ( 1 1 )  
 where Ï‰ is the angular velocity of the sphere. Th e direction of the torq ue in equation (11) 
 is opposite to the direction of the rotation. In the case of a sphere ro tating in the quiescent 
 dark matter field fluid with angular velocity Ï‰, similar to equation (2), the proposed T 
 exerted on the sphere is 
 ()Ï‰ Ï€Î· m r Tn318âˆ’âˆ’ =      ( 1 2 )  
 The direction of the torque in  equation (12) is opposite to the direction of the rotation. 
 The torque causes the negative angular acceleration 
    dtdI TÏ‰=       ( 1 3 )  
 where I is the moment of inertia of the sphere in the dark matter field fluid 
  5   ()21
 52nr m Iâˆ’=       ( 1 4 )  
 Therefore, the equation of rotation for the sphere in the dark matter field fluid is 
    Ï‰ Ï€Î·Ï‰nrdtdâˆ’âˆ’ =120      ( 1 5 )  
 Solving this equation yields 
        (16) ) 20 exp(1
 0 t rnâˆ’âˆ’ =Ï€Î· Ï‰ Ï‰
 where Ï‰0 is the initial angul ar velocity. One can see that the angular velocity of the 
 sphere exponentially decreases  with time and the angular de celeration is proportional to 
 its angular velocity.

 The significance of equation (17) is that it contains only observed data without 
 assumptions and undetermined parameters; therefor e, it is a critical test for this model.

 This is another critical test for this model. 
  
 3. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees with the model 
  
  The Earth-Moon system is the simplest gravitational system. The solar system is 
 complex, the Earth and the Moon experience no t only the interaction of the Sun but also 
 interactions of other planets. Let us consider the local Earth-Moon gravitational system as 
 an isolated local gravitational system, i.e., the influence from the Sun and other planets 
  6on the rotation and orbital motion of the Moon and on the rotation of the Earth is 
 assumed negligible compared to the forces  exerted by the Moon and Earth on each other. 
 In addition, the eccentricity of the Moon's or bit is small enough to be ignored. The data 
 about the Moon and the Earth from references (Dickey et .al., 1994,  and Lang, 1992) are 
 listed below for the readers' convenience to verify the calculation because the data may 
 vary slightly with di fferent data sources. 
 Moon: 
     Mean radius:    r  = 1738.0 km 
     Mass:       m = 7.3483 Ã— 1025 gram 
     Rotation period = 27.321661 days 
     Angular velocity of Moon = 2.6617 Ã— 10-6 rad s-1 
     Mean distance to Earth Rm= 384400 km 
     Mean orbital velocity v = 1.023 km s-1 
     Orbit eccentricity    e = 0.0549 
     Angular rotation acceleration rate = -25.88 Â±  0.5 arcsec century-2 
        = (-1.255 Â± 0.024) Ã— 10-4 rad century-2
        = (-1.260 Â± 0.024) Ã— 10-23 rad s-2
     Receding rate from Earth = 3.82 Â±  0.07 cm year-1 = (1.21 Â±  0.02) Ã— 10-9 m s-1 
 Earth: 
     Mean radius:    r  = 6371.0  km 
     Mass:       m = 5.9742 Ã— 1027 gram 
     Rotation period = 23 h 56m  04.098904 s = 86164.098904 s 
     Angular velocity of rotation = 7.292115 Ã— 10-5 rad s-1 
     Mean distance to the Sun R m= 149,597,870.61 km  
     Mean orbital velocity v = 29.78 km s-1 
     Angular acceleration of  Earth = (-5.5 Â± 0.5) Ã— 10-22 rad s-2
 The Moon's angular rotation accele ration rate and increase in mean distance to the Earth 
 (receding rate) were obtained from the lunar laser ranging of the Apollo Program (Dickey 
 et .al., 1994). By inserting the data of th e Moon's rotation and rece ssion into equation 
 (17), the result is 
  7 039 . 0 54 . 1

 The distance R in equation (19) is from th e Moon's center to the Earth's center and the 
 number 384400 km  is assumed to be the distance fr om the Moon's surface to the Earth's 
 surface. Equation (19) is in good agreement with the th eoretical value of -1.67. The result 
 is in accord with the model used here. The difference (about 7.8%) between the values of 
 -1.54 and -1.67 may come from several sources: 
 1. Moon's orbital is not a perfect circle 
 2. Moon is not a perfect rigid sphere. 
 3. The effect from Sun and other planets. 
 4. Errors in data. 
 5. Possible other unknown reasons. 
 The two parameters n  and Î·  in equation (9) and equation (15) can be determined 
 with two data sets.  The third data set can be us ed to further test the model.  If this model 
 correctly describes the situation at hand, it sh ould give consistent results for different 
 motions. The values of n and Î·  calculated from three different  data sets are listed below 
 (Note, the mean distance of the Moon to th e Earth and mean radii of the Moon and the 
 Earth are used in the calculation). 
     The value of n:       n = 0.64 
     From the Moon's rotation:   Î·  = 4.27 Ã—  10-22  s-1 m-1
     From the Earth's rotation:     Î·  = 4.26 Ã— 10-22  s-1 m-1
     From the Moon's recession:  Î· = 4.64 Ã— 10-22  s-1 m-1
 One can see that the three values of Î· are consistent within the range of error in the data. 
     The average value of  Î·:   Î· = (4.39 Â± 0.22) Ã— 10-22 s-1 m-1
 By inserting the data of the Earth's rota tion, the Moonâ€™s recession and the value of n  into 
 equation (18), the result is 
 14 . 0 53 . 163710001738000

   (20) 
 This is also in accord with the model used here. 
 The dragging force exerted on the Moon's orbital motion by the dark matter field 
 fluid is -1.11 Ã— 108 N, this is negligibly small compared to the gravitational force between 
  8the Moon and the Earth ~ 1.90 Ã— 1020 N;  and the torque exerted by the dark matter field 
 fluid on the Earthâ€™s and the Moon' s rotations is T = -5.49 Ã— 1016 Nm and -1.15 Ã— 1012 Nm, 
 respectively.  
  
 4. The evolution of Earth-Moon system 
  
 Sonett  et al. found that the length of the terrestrial day 900 million years ago was 
 about 19.2 hours based on the laminated tidal sediments on the Earth (Sonett et al ., 
 1996). According to the model presented here, back in that time, the length of the day 
 was about 19.2 hours, this ag rees very well with Sonett et al. 's result.  Based on the dark 
 matter field fluid model, and the above result, the closest distance (cen ter to center) of the 
 Moon to the Earth was about 259000 km or about two-thirds of current distance at 4.5 
 billion years ago, this is fa r beyond the Roche's lim it. This number agrees closely with 
 some of earlier Moon-Earth models. The clos est distance of the Moon to the Earth by 
 Hansenâ€™s models was about 38 Earth radii or 242000 km (Hansen, 1982). According to 
 this model, the length of day of the Earth wa s about 8 hours at 4.5 b illion years ago. Fig. 
 1 shows the evolution of the distance of Moon to the Earth and the length of day of the 
 Earth with the age of the Ea rth-Moon system described by this model along with data 
 from Kvale et al. (1999), Sonett et al. (1996) and Scrutton (1978). One can see that those 
 data fit this model very well in their time range.  
 Fig. 2 shows the geological  data of solar days year-1 from Wells (1963) and from 
 Sonett et al. (1996) and the desc ription (solid line) by this dark matter field fluid model 
 for past 900 million years. One can see that  the model agrees with the geological and 
 fossil data beautifully.  
 The important difference of this model w ith early models in describing the early 
 evolution of the Earth-Moon system is that this  model is based only on current data of the 
 Earth-Moon system and there are no assumptions about the conditions of earlier Earth 
 rotation and continental drifting. Based on this  model, the Earth-M oon system has been 
 smoothly evolving to the current position since it was established and the recessional rate 
 of the Moon has been gradually increasing, however, this description do es not take it into 
 account that there might be speci al events happened in the past to cause the suddenly 
  9significant changes in the motions of the Eart h and the Moon, such as strong impacts by 
 giant asteroids and comets, etc, because those impacts are very co mmon in the universe. 
 The general pattern of the evolution of the Earth-Moon system described by this model 
 agrees with geological evidence. Based on equa tion (9), the recessional rate exponentially 
 increases with time. One may then imagine th at the recessional rate  will quickly become 
 very large.  The increase is in fact extremely slow. The Moon's recessional rate will be 
 3.04 Ã— 10-9 m s-1 after 10 billion years and 7.64 Ã— 10-9 m s-1 after 20 billion years. 
 However, whether the Moon's r ecession will continue or at  some time later another 
 mechanism will take over is not known. It should be understood that the tidal friction 
 does affect the evolution of the Earth itself such  as the surface crust structure, continental 
 drifting and evolution of bio-sy stem, etc; it may also play a role in slowing the Earthâ€™s 
 rotation, however, such role is  not a dominant mechanism.  
 Unfortunately, there is no data available for the changes of the Earth's orbital 
 motion and all other members of solar system. According to this model and above results, 
 the recessional rate of the Earth should be 6.86 Ã— 10-7 m s-1 = 21.6 m year-1 = 2.16 km 
 century-1, the length of a year increases about 6.8 ms and the change of the temperature is 
 -1.8 Ã— 10-8 K year-1 with constant radiation level of th e Sun and the stable environment on 
 the Earth. The length of a year at 1 billion years ago would be 80% of the current length 
 of the year. However, much evidence (growth-bands of corals and shellfish as well as some other evidences) suggest th at there has been no apparent change in the length of the 
 year over the billion years and the Earth's orbita l motion is more stable than its rotation in 
 which it experiences the dragging torque by the da rk matter field fluid.  This suggests that 
 dark matter field fluid is circulating around Sun with the same  direction and similar speed 
 of Earth (at least in the Earth's orbital ra nge). Therefore, the Earth's orbital motion 
 experiences very little or no dragging force from the dark matter field fluid. However, 
 this is a conjecture, extensive research has to be conducted to verify if  this is the case.  
  
 5. Skeptical description of the evolution of the Mars 
  
 The Mars is our nearest ne ighbor which has attracted gr eat attention since ancient 
 time. The exploration of the Mars has been heating up in recent decades. NASA, Russian 
  10and Europe Space Agency sent many space crafts to the Mars to collect data and study 
 this mysterious planet. So far there is still not enough data about  the history of this planet 
 to describe its evolution. Same as the Earth,  the Mars rotates about its central axis and 
 revolves around the Sun, howev er, the Mars does not have a massive moon circulating it 
 and there is no liquid fluid on its surface, ther efore, there is no apparent ocean-like tidal 
 friction force to slow its rota tion by tidal friction theories. Based on the above result and 
 current the Mars's data, this model predicts that the Marsâ€™s rotati on also experiences the 
 dragging torque by the dark matter field fluid and the angular rotati on acceleration of the 
 Mars should be about -4.38 Ã— 10-22 rad s-2. Figure 3 describes the possible evolution of 
 the length of day and the solar days/Mars year , the vertical dash line marks the current 
 age of the Mars with assumption that the Mars  was formed in a similar time period of the 
 Earthâ€™s formation. Such description is complete ly skeptical due to lack of reliable data. 
 The research and exploration of the Mars has been expanded dram atically in recent 
 decades. We shall feel confident that the reliable data about the angular rotation 
 acceleration of the Mars will be available in th e near future which will provide a vital test 
 for the predication of this model. However, there are also other factors which may affect the Mars rotation rate such as mass redist ribution due to season change, winds, possible 
 volcano eruptions and Mars quake s. Therefore the data has to be carefully analyzed. 
  
 5. Discussion about the model 
  
 From the above results, one can see that the current Earth-Moon data and the 
 geological and fossil data agree with the mode l very well and the pa st evolution of the 
 Earth-Moon system can be described by th e model without intr oducing any additional 
 parameters; this model reveals the interesting relationship between the rotation and receding (Eq. 17 and Eq. 18) of the same celestial body or different celestial bodies in the same gravitational system, such relationshi p is not known before. Such success can not 
 be explained by â€œcoincidenceâ€ or â€œluckâ€ because of so many data involved (current 
 Earthâ€™s and Moonâ€™s data and geological and fossil data) if one thinks that this is a wrong 
 model, although the chance for the natural ha ppening of such â€œcoincidenceâ€ or â€œluckâ€ 
 could be greater than wining a jackpot lotter y; otherwise, a new theory from different 
  11approach can be developed to give the same or better description as this model does.  It is 
 certain that this model is not perfect and ma y have defects, further development may be 
 conducted.  
 James Clark Maxwell said in 1873 â€œ The vast interplanetary and interstellar 
 regions will no longer be regarde d as waste places in the universe, which the Creator has 
 not seen fit to fill with the symbols of th e manifold order of His kingdom. We shall find 
 them to be already full of this wonderf ul medium; so full, that no human power can 
 remove it from the smallest portion of space, or produce the slightest flaw in its infinite 
 continuity. It extends unbr oken from star to starâ€¦ .â€  The medium that Maxwell talked 
 about is the aether which was proposed as the carrier of light wave propagation. The 
 Michelson-Morley experiment only proved th at the light wave propagation does not 
 depend on such medium and did not reject the existence of the medium in the interstellar 
 space.  In fact, the concept of the interstellar medium has been developed dramatically 
 recently such as the dark matter, dark energy, cosmic fluid, etc. The d ark matter field 
 fluid is just a part of such wonderful me dium and â€œpreciselyâ€ de scribed by Maxwell. 
  
 6. Conclusion 
  
 The evolution of the Earth-Moon system can  be described by the dark matter field 
 fluid model and the current data of the Eart h and the Moon fit this model very well. At 
 4.5 billion years ago, the closest distance of the Moon to the Earth could be about 259000 km, which is far beyond the Rocheâ€™s limit and the length of day was about 8 hours. The 
 general pattern of the evoluti on of the Earth-Moon system described by this model agrees 
 with geological and fossil evidence. The tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth-Moon system. This model predicts that the Marsâ€™s rotation is 
 also slowing with the angular a cceleration rate about -4.38 Ã— 10
 -22 rad s-2.

  The evolution of Moonâ€™s distance and the length of day of the earth with the age 
 of the Earth-Moon system. Solid lines are calc ulated according to the dark matter field 
 fluid model. Data sources: the Mo on distances are from Kvale and et a l. and for the 
 length of day: (a and b) are from Scrutton ( page 186, fig. 8), c is from Sonett and et al.  
 The dash line marks the current age of the Earth-Moon system.

 The evolution of Solar days of year w ith the age of the Earth-Moon system. The 
 solid line is calculated according to dark matt er field fluid model. The data are from 
 Wells (3.9 ~ 4.435 billion years range), Sonett  (3.6 billion years) and current age (4.5 
 billion years).

 The skeptical description of the evoluti on of Marsâ€™s length of day and the solar 
 days/Mars year with the age of the Mars based on the dark matter field fluid model 
 (assuming that the Marsâ€™s age is about 4.5 billion years). The vertical dash line marks the 
 current age of Mars.
