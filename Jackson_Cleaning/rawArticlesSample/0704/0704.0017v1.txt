 velocities near âˆ¼500âˆ’600 km sâˆ’1. These velocities are consistent with those of material
 circulating at the outer edge of the accretiondisc, suggest ingcorotation of the accretion cur-
 tain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler tomograms have
 revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extend ing from velocities of âˆ¼500 km

 Evidence for overï¬‚ow stream of material falling onto the mag netosphere was observed,

 It appears that the H Î²and HÎ³spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the

 1 INTRODUCTION
 EXHya is anIntermediate Polar(IP),a sub-class of magnetic Cat-
 aclysmic Variable Stars (mCVs) where a late-type main seque nce
 star transfers material to the magnetic white dwarf star as t he two
 stars orbit each other under the inï¬‚uence of their mutual gra v-
 itation. Unlike in Polars, another subclass of mCVs, where t he
 white dwarf is in synchronous rotation with the binary rotat ion
 (Pspin=Porb),the whitedwarf inan IPisinasynchronous rotation
 with the orbital motion of the system. EX Hya, however, is nea rer
 synchronismthanthemajorityofIPsasithasaspinperiod( âˆ¼67.03
 min) which is about 2 /3 its orbital period (98.26 min) (Mumford
 1967; Hellier etal. 1987), and is one of only six out of thirty nine
 conï¬rmedIPswithitsorbitalperiodbelowthe2-3hCVperiod gap
 (Nortonet al. 2004).It has aninclination i=78â—¦Â±1â—¦.
 Recent studies have shown that EX Hya does not conform
 to the traditional IP model (King& Wynn 1999; Wynn 2000;
 Belleet al. 2002; Nortonet al. 2004; Belleet al. 2005). This sys-
 â‹†E-mail: nceba@circinus.ast.uct.ac.zatem has a large Pspin/Porbratio (âˆ¼0.68) implying that it can-
 not be in the usual spin equilibrium rotation since most IPs
 have been shown to attain spin equilibrium near Pspin/Porbâˆ¼
 0.1 (King&Wynn 1999; Wynn 2000). This further implies that
 the corotation radius is far greater than the circularisati on radius
 (Rcoâ‰«Rcir) and that EX Hya cannot possess a Keplerian disc.
 Systems with Keplerian discs are expected to have Rco<Rcirand
 thus a smaller Pspin/Porb. These factors have prompted theorists to
 suggest that the spin equilibrium state in EX Hya is determin ed
 byRcoâˆ¼b, wherebis the distance to the inner Lagrangian point,
 L1(King& Wynn 1999; Wynn 2000; Norton etal. 2004). In this
 model the accretion curtains extend to near the L1point, and EX
 Hya resembles an asynchronous Polar where most of the materi al
 accretes viathe stream(King& Wynn 1999;Wynn 2000)andvia
 both the ringof material near the Roche lobe radius of the pri mary
 and the stream (Norton etal. 2004), depending on the orbital and
 spin periods of the system, and the magnetic ï¬eld strength. I n the
 later publication it was shown that material in EX Hya is fed f rom
 a ring of material at the outer edge of the Roche lobe, and that for

 2 OBSERVATIONSAND DATA REDUCTION
 2.1 1991 Observations
 EX Hya was observed in April of 1991 by Buckley et al. (1991)
 usingtheSAAO1.9-mtelescope withtheReticonphotoncount ing
 system (RPCS)detector on the Cassegrainspectrograph. A gr ating
 with a resolution of 1200 mmâˆ’1was used and a wavelength range
 of 4000 - 5080 ËšA was covered at a spectral resolution of Î”Î»âˆ¼1.2
 ËšA and at a time resolution of 100 - 120 s. The spectrograph slit
 width was 250 Âµm (âˆ¼1.5 arcsecs). Wavelength calibration expo-
 sures were taken using a CuAr arc lamp. Three nights of observ a-
 tions (24, 25 and 29 April 1991) were covered in quiescence an d,
 in total, 262 spectra were obtained. The observing log is giv en in
 Table 1together withthe startingtimesof the observations .
 Following wavelength-calibration and sky-subtraction, t he
 data were ï¬‚ux calibrated using the spectra of the standard st ar
 LTT3864.
 2.2 2001 Observations
 The2001observations wereobtainedusingtheSITeCCDdetec tor
 (266Ã—1798 pixels) on the Cassegrain spectrograph of the SAAO
 1.9-m telescope. A grating with a resolution of 1200 mmâˆ’1was
 used over the wavelength range 4200 - 5100 ËšA on the nights of
 the 25th and 26th April. Another grating witha resolution of 1200
 mmâˆ’1was used on the 24th, 25th and 26th April over the range
 6300 - 7050 ËšA. The spectral resolution was âˆ¼1.0ËšA and a 1 Ã—2
 binning scheme was employed (i.e. binning by 2 Ã—in the spatial
 direction). The exposure times during observations were 60 s. The
 observations covered the period 24 April - 26 April 2001 and, in
 total, 262 spectra were obtained (Table 1). The extraction a nd re-
 duction of the data were performed the standard way using the
 Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF)1package and the
 1IRAF is a software package for the reduction and analysis of a stronom-
 ical data distributed by National Optical Astronomy Observ atory (NOAO)Figure 1. Radial-velocity Fourier amplitude spectra from the 1991 co m-

 3 THERADIAL VELOCITIES
 ItiswidelyacceptedthatinacanonicalCV,thehighvelocit yemis-
 sion line wings are formed in the inner parts of the accretion disc
 orbiting close to the white dwarf and thus should reï¬‚ect its o rbital
 motion (Shafter 1983; Shafter &Szkody 1984; Shafter 1985).
 In IPs, however, high velocity emission line wings are forme d
 in the gas streaming towards the white dwarf at high velociti es
 (Hellieretal. 1987; Ferrario& Wickramasinghe 1993). The r a-
 dial velocities were determined by measuring the wings of th e HÎ²
 and HÎ³emission lines from the 1991 data (24 and 25/04/91 - the
 data obtained on the 29th was not added since EX Hya had not
 fully recovered from outburst); and the wings of H Î±, HÎ²and HÎ³
 emission lines from the 2001 data using the Gaussian Convolu tion
 which is operated by the Association of Universities for Res earch in As-
 tronomy (AURA)

 used with Î±values ranging from 3500 to 100 km sâˆ’1and corre-
 sponding widthvalues from 1200 to100 km sâˆ’1.
 3.1 PeriodSearches
 The radial velocities were Fourier transformed using the Di screte
 Fourier Transform (DFT) algorithm to search for any periods in
 the data (Deeming 1975; Kurtz 1985). The H Î²and HÎ³amplitude
 spectra from 1991 (24 and 25 April)are shown inFigure 1and th e
 HÎ±amplitude spectra from2001 are showninFigure 2.
 A prominent peak at a frequency corresponding to the 98-
 minute orbital frequency, Î©, is observed in all the emission lines.
 Second in strength to the orbital frequency is the spin frequ ency,
 Ï‰, of the narrow s-wave component (NSC) ( Î±=900,1200 km
 sâˆ’1) (Figures 1 and 2). The third panels from the top in Figures 1
 and 2show the data after prewhitening by Î©. Power at Ï‰is clearly
 present.
 The spin frequency was not detected at high values of Î±
 (Î±=3000,3500 km sâˆ’1) where it is most expected (since at these
 velocitiesthematerialisquiteclosetothewhitedwarfand itsemis-
 sion is expected to be modulated at the white dwarf spin perio d).It was alsonot present in H Î²and HÎ³radial velocities of 2001. The
 amplitude of Ï‰relativeto Î©wasfound tobe âˆ¼81% for H Î²,âˆ¼64%
 for HÎ³andâˆ¼18% for H Î±.
 4 ORBITALVARIATIONSOF THEEMISSIONLINES
 The data were phase-binned on the orbital ephemeris of Helli er &
 Sprouts (1992),
 Teclipse =2437699 .94179 +0.068233846 (4)E, (1)
 whereEis the number of orbital cycles and T is the time of mid-
 eclipse.Thisephemeris isdeï¬nedbythezeropoint ofmid-ec lipse,
 where minimum intensity is at phase 0.0. This means that for t he
 radial velocities,maximum blueshift isperpendicular tot he line of
 centres, at phase 0.75, meaning that spectroscopic phase ze ro oc-
 curs at the blue-to-red crossing of the emission line radial velocity
 curve. 40phase bins were used toproduce the radial velociti es.
 4.1 OrbitalTomograms andTrailed Spectra
 The HÎ±, HÎ²and HÎ³Doppler tomograms were computed using
 the Back Projection Method (BPM) with the application of a ï¬l -
 ter, and the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) (Marsh& Horne
 1988;Marsh 1988;Horne 1991;Spruit 1998).TheBPMDoppler
 maps are shown in Figure 3 and those constructed using MEM are
 shown in Figure 4. Error in ephemerides (both orbital and spi n) is
 sufï¬ciently small to phase all of our data accurately on the o rbital
 andspin cycles.
 A velocity amplitude of the primary, K1=74Â±2 km sâˆ’1
 from our radial velocity measurements and that of the second ary,
 K2=360Â±35 km sâˆ’1, taken from Vande Putte et al. (2003) and
 Beuermannetal.(2003),wereusedtoï¬xthepositionsoftheR oche
 lobe and the stream trajectories on the tomograms. A seconda ry
 mass,M2=0.10Â±0.01 M âŠ™for EX Hya was derived from the up-
 to-datesecondary mass-periodrelationof Smith&Dhillon( 1998).
 The mass of the primary, M1, was then determined from the above
 values usingK1
 K2=M2
 M1,and was found tobe 0.50 Â±0.05 M âŠ™.
 The HÎ², HÎ³and HeI Î»4471 Doppler tomograms (Figure 3
 and 4) show strong emission at the bright spot, some at the Roc he
 lobe and the stream, and some from the disc. Those of H Î±also
 show strong bright spot emission but less or no emission from the
 stream.DiscemissionisdiminishedinH Î±whencomparedtoother
 emissionlines,especiallyathighervelocities.Thisismo reobvious
 in the BPM tomogram. The bright spot emission falls near the r e-
 gion (-100, 350) km sâˆ’1. Average-subtracted trailed spectra (Fig-
 ure 4) show the corresponding NSC. âˆ¼1Ã—10âˆ’11ergs cmâˆ’2sâˆ’1
 (âˆ¼60-70%) of the original line ï¬‚uxes is contained in the averag e-
 subtracted proï¬les of H Î²and HÎ³, andâˆ¼1Ã—10âˆ’12ergs cmâˆ’2sâˆ’1
 (âˆ¼80-90%) is contained inH Î±and HeIÎ»4471. This ï¬‚uxis mainly
 due tothebright spotandthe stream.Thetrailedspectra hav ebeen
 repeatedover 2cycles for clarity.
 The trailed spectra of 2001 have revealed two interesting fe a-
 tures. The ï¬rst one is the asymmetry in the intensity of the s- wave
 (Figure 4). In H Î±, the red wing of the NSC is brighter at Ï†98âˆ¼
 0.1âˆ’0.3andseemstoreachmaximumbrightnessnear Ï†98âˆ¼0.25,
 whereas the blue wing is dimmer in the range Ï†98âˆ¼0.7âˆ’0.9 and
 seems toreach minimum brightness near Ï†98âˆ¼0.75. A similar ef-
 fectisseenintheH Î²andtheH Î³lines,andtoalesser extentinHeI
 Î»4471. The second feature is redshifted emission extending f rom
 the NSCto highvelocities ( âˆ¼1000 km sâˆ’1) at earlybinary phases
 (Ï†98âˆ¼0.0âˆ’0.2).

 Method with the application of a ï¬lter (top panels) and after subtracting the average of the line proï¬le (bottom panels). The positions of the Roche lobe and
 stream trajectories areshown (velocity amplitudes of K1=74kmsâˆ’1andK2=360 kmsâˆ’1for theprimary and secondary stars,respectively, wereuse d).The
 two curves with marked intervals represent the gas stream ve locity (upper curve) and the Keplerian velocity along the st ream (lower curve). Thecircles on all
 tomograms represent 0.1 of the distance from the L 1point to the primary. The three crosses are centres of mass of the secondary, system and primary, from
 top-to-bottom. The asterisk represents the velocity of clo sest approach. All the maps are plotted on the same velocity s cale. The lookup table of this ï¬gure is
 such that the brightest emission features appear with decre asing intensity from yellow/green to light blue in the onlin e edition, or white to grey in the printed
 edition.
 The reconstructed trailed spectra suggest that this latter fea-
 ture is another s-wave, which we shall refer to as the high vel ocity
 component (HVC), crossing the NSC near Ï†98âˆ¼0.2âˆ’0.3. The
 Doppler tomograms show emission extending from the bright s pot
 position,passingalongthestreampath,tothebottom-left quadrant
 at high velocities near 1000 km sâˆ’1which is responsible for the
 HVC; most of this emission does not fall within the disc and ga s
 streamvelocities onthe map,suggesting thatthere wassmal lor no
 overlapof the stream component withthedisc.
 The1991tomogramsshowedsimilarresults.Itisworthnotin g
 thatmostofthediscemissionin1991camefromtheouterdisc than
 in2001.
 Even though the MEM and BPM pick out the same features,
 in the BP tomograms some features are more prominent than in
 the MEM tomograms while the reconstruction obtained using t he
 MEMreproduces the observed data well.
 The advantage of BPM over MEM is that it is faster and it
 is easier to get a consistent set of maps of different emissio n lines
 (interms of the apparent noise in the images). For this reaso n both
 methods have been used.
 5 SPINVARIATIONSOFTHE EMISSIONLINES
 5.1 TheSpinRadial VelocityCurve
 The radial velocities were phase-folded using 30 bins on the
 quadratic spin ephemeris of Hellier & Sproats (1992), where spin
 maximum was deï¬ned as Ï†67=0. Figure 5 shows the variation of
 theHÎ²,HÎ³andHÎ±narrowcomponentswith Ï‰.Maximumblueshift
 isseen at Ï†67=0.79for HÎ²and atÏ†67=0.77 forHÎ³.Whereas for
 HÎ±, maximum blueshift is seen at Ï†67=0.90. It should be noted
 thatHÎ±andHÎ²/HÎ³havenotbeenobservedsimultaneouslyandsoboth data sets probably sample the spin phases at different o rbital
 phases.

 twocomponents areinphase.Theradialvelocityvariationw iththe
 spin period of the H Î²and HÎ³broad-base component could not be
 detected, possibly due to velocity cancellation We discuss this in
 Section6.
 5.2 SpinTomograms andTrailed Spectra
 Spin tomograms of EX Hya were constructed by Hellier (1999)
 but revealed little information. Also, Belleet al. (2005) o bserved
 no coherent emission site/s on their tomograms folded on the spin
 phase.
 The HÎ²and the H Î³BPM and MEM spin tomograms from
 2001, however, have revealed a coherent emission site betwe en
 Vxâˆ¼500 km sâˆ’1andâˆ¼1000 km sâˆ’1which is evidence of emis-
 sion from the accretion curtains (Figures 7 and 8). But it is a well
 knownfact thatsince thespinperiodis âˆ¼2
 3ofthe orbitalperiodin
 EX Hya, orbital cycle variations do not smear out when folded on
 the spin phase but repeat every 3 spin cycles (Hellieret al. 1 987).
 Thisisthought tobetheoriginofmostofthestructureinthe emis-
 sion lines at velocities <1000 km sâˆ’1(Hellier 1999). To address
 thisproblem,phase-invariantsubtractionisperformedwh ereemis-
 sion that does not vary with the spin cycle is subtracted from the
 data. This is achieved by measuring minimum ï¬‚ux at each wave-
 length and subtracting this value. The results are shown int he sec-
 ondpanelsfromthetopofFigure8.Itshouldbementionedtho ugh,
 that even subtracting the invariant part of the line proï¬les does not
 guaranteethattheinï¬‚uenceoftheorbitalperiodvariation shasbeen
 completelyremoved.

 wave near Ï†67âˆ¼0.1âˆ’0.6 that extends to high velocities in the

 to the HVC (Section 4.1). The corresponding emission in the H Î±
 tomograms extending tohigher velocitiesintheredspectra l region
 isnot clear.
 Both the H Î²and HÎ³phase-invariant subtracted trailedspectra
 show three weak-intensity spin-waves. The most clearly vis ible of
 the three is phased with maximum redshift near Ï†67âˆ¼0.3âˆ’0.4,
 with an estimated velocity amplitude of âˆ¼900 km sâˆ’1and corre-
 sponds to the emission near the â€œ3 oâ€™clockâ€ position in the to mo-
 gram (Figure 8). The reconstructed trailed spectra reprodu ce the
 observed data.
 The HÎ²and HÎ³trailed spectra in Figure 7 seem to support
 these results. The emission observed near the â€œ3 oâ€™clock pos itionâ€
 in the tomograms has also been seen in other IPs such as AO Psc
 andFOAqr(Hellier 1999)andwasinterpretedas emanatingfr om
 the upper accretioncurtain.
 The spin-waves are weak in intensity though, and more data
 are needed tosupport these results.

 c/circlecopyrt0000 RAS,MNRAS 000, 000â€“000SpectroscopicStudyoftheIP EXHydraein Quiescence 7
 (1999). Their revised model suggested that the magnetic ï¬el d in

 of the Roche lobe causing:
 â€¢part or all of the non-Keplerian disc (hereafter the ringof m a-

 to be controlled by the magnetic ï¬eld, forming two chunks alo ng

 Recently,Nortonetal.(2004,2004a) haveshownthatforsys -
 tems with Pspin/Porbâˆ¼0.72, when the mass ratio is smaller at
 q=0.2, the material forms a ring near the edge of the primary
 Rochelobe,fromwhereaccretioncurtainsfunneldowntothe white
 dwarf surface, in agreement with King & Wynn (1999) and Belle
 et al. (2002). The material is fed from the ring (ring-fed acc retion)
 and channeled along the magnetic ï¬eld lines (when the angle b e-
 tween the white dwarf spin axis and magnetic dipole axis is sm all
 i.e<30â—¦,whichis true for EXHya).
 The discussion by Eisenbart etal. (2002) on the IR-UV ï¬‚ux
 distributioninEXHyaimpliesadisc(isobaricandisotherm al)with
 an outer radius of 1.6 Ã—1010cm and a thickness of 2 Ã—108cm, and
 an assumed central hole of 6 Ã—109cm, but Eisenbart et al. (2002)
 suggested that the structure could also be a ring with a large r in-
 ner radius, in line with the suggestion of King& Wynn (1999);
 Belleet al. (2002) and Norton etal. (2004). They found that t he
 disc component contains about 1/6 of the total ï¬‚ux which is a b it
 more than expected from gravitational energy release at the inner
 radius, R in>6Ã—109cm.
 Our spectroscopic data support both the model of Belle et al.
 (2002) and Norton et al. (2004) in which material from a ring, cir-
 cling the white dwarf and co-rotating with the magnetic ï¬eld lines
 atthe outer edge of theRoche lobe, isaccretedbythe whitedw arf.
 Thepresenceofthebrightspotrevealedbythetrailedspect ra,
 the DFTs of the radial velocities and the Doppler maps (Figur es 3
 and 4) suggest the presence of a disc or ring of material exten ding
 tonear the Roche lobe radius,around thewhite dwarf. Whenco m-
 paring the 1991 and 2001 tomograms for the H Î²they appear to be
 in the same state or similar, given the fact that they are ten y ears
 apart. It is reassuring that the fact that the twogroups of li nes have
 not been measured simultaneously is not a signiï¬cant proble m in
 the analysis.
 More importantly, a spin pulse modulated at velocities con-
 sistent with those of the material circulating at the outer e dge of
 the disc ( âˆ¼500âˆ’600 km sâˆ’1) (Figures 1 and 2) was detected and

 velocities mentioned above were not caused by motion perpen dic-

 caused byvelocity cancellationas willbe shown later.
 A spin wave was detected in the spin-folded trailed spectra
 of HÎ±(Figure 8) with a velocity semi-amplitude of âˆ¼500-600
 km sâˆ’1. The spin wave shows maximum blue-shift near phase
 Ï†67âˆ¼1.0 (when the upper magnetic pole is pointed away from
 theobserver) andmaximumredshiftnear phase Ï†67âˆ¼0.5.TheHÎ±

 isconsistentwiththeaccretioncurtainmodel ofIPsandisp ossible
 if accretion occurs via a disc/ring. The spin tomograms (Fig ures 7and 8) show evidence of the accretion curtain emission exten ding
 fromâˆ¼500kmsâˆ’1tohighvelocities( âˆ¼1000kmsâˆ’1),suggesting
 that material is channeled along the ï¬eld lines from the oute r ring.
 The HÎ±narrow and broad base components show similar phase
 variation, suggesting same position of maximum radial velo city as
 shown inFigures 6and 9(line OA).This indicates that materi alis
 channeled from the ring(at low velocities) tohigh velociti es along
 the ï¬eldlines.
 A mass ratio of qâˆ¼0.2 was measured from our data, and so
 the periodratio Pspin/Porbâˆ¼0.68isconsistent withthe ringaccre-
 tionmodel of Nortonet al.(2004).
 Decreased prominence of the narrow s-wave component
 aroundÏ†98=0.57âˆ’0.87 (Figure 3 and 4) was observed and sug-
 gests the presence of VEM at the outer edge of the ring of ma-
 terial obscuring the emission at these phases. The presence of the
 overï¬‚ow stream may be infered from this observation (Bellee t al.
 2005).Butdirectevidence comes from orbitalDoppler tomog rams
 which show an asymmetry in the emission, where more emission
 is observed from the secondary Roche lobe to the lower left qu ad-
 rant than from the opposite side. Average-subtracted orbit al tomo-
 gramsshowthisemissionathighervelocities( âˆ¼900-1000kmsâˆ’1)
 (Figures 3 and 4), and it corresponds to the HVC observed in th e
 trailedspectra, which is modulated witha velocitysemi-am plitude
 ofâˆ¼1000 km sâˆ’1. This HVC is reminiscent of that detected by
 Rosen et al. (1987) in the trailed spectra of the AM Her system
 V834 Cen. Their HVC was blueshifted with a velocity of 900 km
 sâˆ’1and was said to be produced in the stream close to the white
 dwarf. The only difference is that there was no evidence of th e
 HVCemissionwhenitwasexpectedtobeseenredwardofanothe r
 component (medium-velocity component) intheir data,wher eas in
 EX Hya the evidence of the HVC emission is missing between
 Ï†98âˆ¼0.3âˆ’0.85. The HVC emission is maximally blueshifted at
 Ï†98âˆ¼0.3âˆ’0.4.Thisphasingisconsistent withtheexpectedphase
 of impact of a stream of material from the secondary withthe d isc
 or of the overï¬‚ow stream material free-falling onto the magn eto-
 sphere of the primary (Hellieretal. 1989).
 Support for overï¬‚ow stream is also provided by spin tomo-
 grams where emission is observed on the upper accretion curt ain
 withvelocitiesconsistent withstreamvelocities.Thissu ggests that
 thisemissionsitemayalsohave resulteddue toimpactof ove rï¬‚ow
 streamwiththemagnetosphere. The resultingemissionisre ceding
 from the observer at maximum redshift near Ï†67âˆ¼0.4 (Figure 8),
 inagreement withthe accretioncurtain model.
 The model of King& Wynn (1999) is not fully supported by
 our observations since itpredicts direct accretionviaa st ream.Our
 observations, however, ï¬t the models of Nortonet al. (2004) and
 Belleet al. (2002, 2005). There is evidence for strong H Î±emis-
 sion of the narrow s-wave component in the spin tomograms, ce n-
 tred around âˆ¼100 km sâˆ’1(Figure 8), that is not accounted for by
 these models. This emission shows maximum blueshift at phas e
 Ï†67âˆ¼0.2, suggesting thatthese are rotationalvelocities (ora com -
 bination of streaming and rotational velocities) of the ant iphased
 motion of a source locked to the white dwarf. One possible exp la-
 nation is that this emission comes from the opposite pole of t he
 white dwarf, at a radial distance of 6 Ã—109cm (âˆ¼8Rwd). Siegel
 (1989) found that the eclipsed optical source in EX Hya is cen tred
 at a radial distance of 1.5 Ã—109cm (âˆ¼2Rwd), which is about four
 times closer to the white dwarf compared to our result. This c ould

 6.1 Whitedwarfandsecondary masses
 Hellieret al. (1987) showed that maximum line widths of Â±3500
 km sâˆ’1constrain the mass of the white dwarf, and a free-fall
 velocity of this magnitude could be achieved for white dwarf
 masses greater than 0.48 M âŠ™. We found M 1=0.50Â±0.05MâŠ™,
 in good agreement with the results obtained from recent stud -
 ies by Hoogerwerf et al. (2004); Beuermann et al. (2003) and
 Vande Putte etal. (2003).
 For the secondary, we derived M 2=0.10Â±0.01 M âŠ™from
 thesecondarymass-periodrelationofSmith&Dhillon(1988 ),and
 this value agrees with that obtained by Vande Putteet al. (20 03).Beuermann etal. (2003) and Hoogerwerf et al. (2004) ï¬nd lowe r
 values for M 2consistent with0.09 M âŠ™. Eisenbart et al. (2002) ar-
 gues that for a secondary mass as low as 0.1 M âŠ™the secondary
 wouldhave tobe substantiallyexpanded by âˆ¼10%.
 6.2 Therevised modelof EX Hya
 We propose a model where one of the two chunks alluded to by
 Belle et al. (2002), which are formed by the magnetic pull alo ng
 theaccretionring,co-rotateswiththeaccretioncurtains attheouter
 edgeoftheRochelobeat âˆ¼500-600kmsâˆ’1,givingrisetothepul-
 sationof emissionat the spinperiodwhichwe observe inour d ata,
 while the other is hidden by the accretion curtain below the r ing
 of material. The resulting emission is maximally blueshift ed near
 Ï†67âˆ¼0.8 (Figure 5). In the accretion curtain model, at Ï†67âˆ¼0.5
 inthespincycle,minimum ï¬‚ux(duetohigheropacity)isobse rved
 when the upper accretion pole of the white dwarf is pointed to -
 wards the observer (Hellieret al. 1987), and so the phasing m en-
 tioned above is compatible with the motion of a rotating accr etion
 funnel. This is illustrated in Figure 10, where the position of the
 observer at pulse maximum is indicated, and the axis of the ma g-
 netic pole is shown. The disruption of the disc by the magneti c
 ï¬eld at the outer disc is illustrated and part of the disc co-r otating
 with the magnetosphere is shown. At a corotation radius, Rcâˆ¼
 b=a(0.500âˆ’0.227logM2
 M1)(âˆ¼3Ã—1010cm), the material is ro-
 tating at a velocity of v2=GM
 bâˆ¼500 km sâˆ’1, in good agreement
 with the observations. Also, a rotation velocity of âˆ¼600 km sâˆ’1
 wasmeasuredfromthespectraandtheradialdistancefromth estar
 to the ring of material was found to be âˆ¼3Ã—1010cm, which is
 similar to b, for a white dwarf mass of 0.5 M âŠ™(Keplerian motion
 about the white dwarf had to be assumed in these calculations ).
 At this radius, the accretion curtain is also rotating at a ve locity of
 2Ï€Rco/Pspinâˆ¼500 km sâˆ’1.

 subtracted proï¬le of H Î±shows radial velocity variations with the
 spin period. Assuming that H Î²and HÎ³also show a similar ï¬‚ux
 variation (H Î²and HÎ³spin tomograms also show a low-velocity s-
 wave but this result is not secured due to poor quality of data ),
 the total line ï¬‚uxes showing radial velocity variations wit h the
 spin period can be estimated to be âˆ¼2Ã—10âˆ’11ergs cmâˆ’2sâˆ’1
 for the three emission lines. This is âˆ¼2/10 of the total disc ï¬‚ux
 (Eisenbart etal. 2002), suggesting that only part of the rin g coro-
 tates withthe white dwarf while the rest of the materialmay b e in-
 volvedinanearKeplerianmotion(thisisaroughcomparison since
 the ï¬‚uxis integrated over one spin cycle for H Î±,HÎ²and HÎ³inour
 data whereas Eisenbart etal. (2002) derived their total ï¬‚ux values
 fromonespectrumoverthewavelengthrange Î»=912âˆ’24000ËšA).
 While some of the ring material co-rotates with the accre-
 tion curtains (i.e. remains in the disc rather than being imm edi-
 ately channeled along the ï¬eld lines), some is channeled alo ng the
 ï¬eld lines at âˆ¼500 km sâˆ’1towards the white dwarf. There is also
 some material that overï¬‚ows the ring and attaches onto the ma g-
 neticï¬eldlines.Theoverï¬‚owstreamhitsthemagnetosphere , prob-
 ably causing a second bright spot on the slowly rotating magn eto-
 sphere (Figure 10). The overï¬‚ow stream is irradiated by the w hite
 dwarf initsinner regions close tothe whitedwarf (theregio ns fac-
 ing the white dwarf). This results in the HVC emission being o b-
 scured at Ï†98âˆ¼0.4âˆ’0.9, which are phases where the stream is
 viewed from behind-opposite the side facing the white dwarf , hid-
 ing the irradiated inner regions. HVC emission from the stre am is
 blueshifted when that from the narrow s-wave component show s
 maximum redshift. Near Ï†98âˆ¼0.25 the two s-waves intersect, ex-
 plaining the asymmetry in the brightness of the s-wave seen n ear
 Ï†98âˆ¼0.25(Figure 4).Theoverï¬‚ow streamcurls nearlybehindthe
 whitedwarfanditistruncatedbytheï¬eldwhentheuppermagn etic

 Ferrario& Wickramasinghe (1993) andFerrario,Wickramas-
 inghe&King(1993)showedthatinIPstheaccretioncurtainb elow
 the orbital plane can contribute in the radial velocities of a system
 if it can be seen either through the central hole of the trunca ted
 disc, or from below the disc, or both. This effect will result in ve-
 locity cancellation due to nearly equal quantities of mater ial that
 are blueshifted and redshifted on the accretion curtains (F errario,
 Wickramasinghe & King1993).
 In EX Hya where the inclination is high (78â—¦) and the disrup-
 tionradius is large( âˆ¼40 RWD,for a white dwarf mass of 0.5 M âŠ™)
 as proposed inFigure 10, it is clear that we see spin-varying emis-
 sionfromtwooppositemagneticpoles,producingafairlysy mmet-
 ric structure in the spin-folded line proï¬les (Hellieret al . 1987;
 Rosenet al. 1991). If emission from these opposite poles is c an-
 cellingoutthenthesumwillhaveamuchlowervelocity.This could
 explainthe near zeroand low amplitude of the radial velocit yvari-
 ation at the spin period of the H Î²and HÎ³, and HÎ±(/lessorequalslant40 km sâˆ’1)
 broad-base component, respectively (see also Hellieret al . (1987)
 and Ferrario,Wickramasinghe &King(1993)).
 One could take this argument further by suggesting that the
 spin modulation we observe in our data at velocities near âˆ¼500
 km sâˆ’1(Figures 1 and 2) is just the slight asymmetries between
 the two poles. The resulting velocity could just be a measure of
 the degree to which the poles cancel their velocities near Â±3500
 km sâˆ’1(Coel Hellier; private communication). This, however, can -
 not be the case for H Î²and HÎ³since these twoemission lines show
 motion that is consistent with that of a rotating object, sug gesting
 that the line proï¬les are not dominated by the infall velocit ies at
 the two opposite accretion poles. If they were produced clos e to
 the white dwarf then maximum rotational velocity near Â±3500 kmsâˆ’1would be 2 Ï€R/Pspinâˆ¼30km sâˆ’1,which ismuch smaller than
 âˆ¼500 km sâˆ’1. However, rotional velocities close to the ring are
 âˆ¼500 km sâˆ’1. For HÎ±, however, we observe maximum blueshift
 atÏ†67âˆ¼1.0,andsovelocityduetocancellationanywherebetween
 0 andÂ±3500 km sâˆ’1are expected, depending on how much the
 two poles cancel. If both accretion curtains are still visib le and
 symmetric at large radii (which is possible as suggested by F er-
 rario, Wickramasinghe & King (1993) and our model), velocit y
 cancellation will still result in smaller amplitudes than t hose of
 âˆ¼500 km sâˆ’1observed in our data. This would then count against
 the argument above. Furthermore, H Î±orbital Doppler tomograms
 showstrongemissionatthebright spot.Ifour modeliscorre ct,the
 ï¬eldlines should also attract this H Î±dominated material, whichis
 chanelledalong the ï¬eldlines,as alreadyshown above. The v eloc-
 ity of this material due to streaming motion near the outer ri ng is
 less than that of the H Î±broad-base component close to the white
 dwarf, as expected. A strong constraint on our model is that t he
 disruption radius of EX Hya has been shown to be at 5-9 Ã—109cm
 (Hellieretal. 1987;Beuermann etal. 2003)whichimpliesaw hite
 dwarf magnetic moment of Âµâˆ¼7Ã—1031G cm3. For our model
 this would imply that the accretion curtains do not extend to near
 the Roche lobe radius. The theoretical analysis of King &Wyn n
 (1999)andWynn (2000),however, has shownthatequilibrium ro-
 tationispossibleifthemagneticmomentinEXHyafallswith inthe

 7 SUMMARY
 Optical observations of EX Hya and the analysis have suggest ed
 that large accretion curtains extending to a distance close to the
 L1point exist in this system. The DFTs and spin tomograms have
 for the ï¬rst time provided evidence for corotation of the ï¬el d lines
 with the ring material near the Roche lobe. Also, tomography and
 the phasing of the spin waves have suggested that feeding by t he
 accretioncurtainsof thematerialfromthering(ring-feda ccretion)
 takesplace.Theseï¬ndingssupportthemodelsofBelleetal. (2002)
 and Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya and the simulations done by
 Norton et al. (2004a) which have shown that for systems with t he
 parameters of EX Hya, the accreting material forms a ring at t he
 outer edge of the primary Roche lobe, from where accretion cu r-
 tains funnel down tothe whitedwarf surface.
 Evidence for stream overï¬‚ow accretion has been observed.
 The HVC caused by the overï¬‚ow stream disappeared at Ï†98âˆ¼
 0.4âˆ’0.9duetoobscurationbythestream.ObscurationoftheNSC
 atÏ†98âˆ¼0.57âˆ’0.87suggestedthepresenceoftheVEMwhichwas
 irradiatedbythe white dwarf initsinner regions.
 The HÎ±broad-base component shows a radial velocity varia-
 tion with the spin period whereas that of H Î²and HÎ³could not be

 detected. The low-amplitude velocity variations modulate d at the
 spin period for H Î±and for H Î²and HÎ³is explained in terms of ve-
 locitycancellation effects.
 We have provided an explanation for the asymmetry in the
 intensity of the narrow s-wave component seen in EX Hya trail ed
 spectra inthe optical. Thenarrow s-wave component and the H VC
 cross atÏ†98âˆ¼0.25, resulting in the asymmetry in brightness that
 we observe atthese phases.
 The spin-folded trailed spectra are not of good quality and
 more data are needed toconï¬rm these results.
