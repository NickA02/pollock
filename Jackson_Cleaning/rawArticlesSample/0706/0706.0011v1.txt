 Overview of the research 
  
 1.1 Hyperbolic versus parabolic 
 In the description of the ev olution of any physical sy stem, it is mandatory to 
 evaluate, as accurately as possibl e, the order of magnitude of different characteristic time 
 scales, since their relationship with the time scale of observation (t he time during which 
 we assume our description of the system to be valid) w ill determine, al ong with the 
 relevant equations, the evolution pattern. Ta ke a forced damped harmonic oscillator 
 and consider its motion on a time scale much larger than both the damping time and the 
 period of the forced oscillation. Then, what one observes is just a harmonic motion. 
 Had we observed the system on a time scal e of the order of (or smaller) than the 
 damping time, the transient regime would have become apparent. This is rather 
 general and of a very re levant interest when dealing with dissipative systems. It is our 
 purpose here, by means of examples and arguments rela ted to a wide class of 
 phenomena, to emphasize the convenience of resorting to hyperbolic theories when 
 dissipative processes, either outside the st eady-state regime or when the observation 
 time is of the order or shorte r than some characteristic time of the system, are under 
 consideration. Furthermore, as it will be  mentioned below, tr ansient phenomena may 
 affect the way in which the system leaves the equilibrium, thereby affecting the future 
 of the system even for time scales much larger than the relaxation time. 
 Parabolic theories of diss ipative phenomena have long and a venerable history and 
 proved very useful especially in the steady -state regime [1.1]. They exhibit however 
 some undesirable features, such as acausality (s ee e.g., [1.2], [1.3]), that prompted the 
 formulation of hyperbolic theories of dissipati on to get rid of them. This was achieved at 
 the price of extending the set of field variables by including the dissipative fluxes (heat 
 current, non-equilibrium stress es and so on) at the same footing as the classical ones 
 (energy densities, equilibrium pressures, etc), thereby givi ng rise to a set of more 
 physically satisfactory (as they  much better conform with experiments) but involved 
 theories from the mathematical point of view. These theories have the additional 
  3advantage of being backed by  statistical fluctuation theo ry, kinetic theory of gases 
 (Grad's 13-moment approximati on), information theory a nd correlated random walks 
 (at least in the version of Jou et al.) [1.3]. 
 A key quantity in these theories is the relaxation time Ï„ of the corresponding 
 dissipative process. Th is positive-definite quantity has a distinct  physical meaning, 
 namely the time taken by the system to return spontaneously to the steady state 
 (whether of thermodynamic equilibrium or  not) after it has been suddenly removed 
 from it. It is, however, connected  to the mean collision time tc of the particles 
 responsible for the dissipative process It is therefore appropriate to interpret  the 
 relaxation time as the time taken by the corre sponding dissipative fl ow to relax to its 
 steady value. Thus, it is we ll known that the classical Fourier law for heat current, 
 [1.3] 
 T qâˆ‡ âˆ’ =ÎºG                                    (1.1) 
 with K the heat conductivity of the fluid, lead s to a parabolic equation for temperature 
 (diffusion equation)

 ÏÎºÏ‡ Ï‡ = âˆ‡ =âˆ‚âˆ‚         ,2                      (1.2) 
 (where Ï‡, Ï and C p are diffusivity, density and speci fic heat at constant pressure, 
 respectively), which do es not forecast propagation of perturbations along characteristic 
 causal light-cones That is to say, perturbations propagate with infinite speed. This 
 non-causal behavior is easily visualized by taking a look at the thermal conduction in 
 an infinite one dimensional medium. Assuming that the temperature of the line is zero 
 for t < 0, and putting a heat source at x = x 0  when t = 0, the temperature profile for t 
 > 0 is given by

 implying that for t = 0 => T = Î´ (x - x 0), and for 0 01 â‰ â‡’ >= T t t . In other words, 
 the presence of a heat source at x0 is instantaneously felt by all observers on the line, 
 no matter how far away from x0  they happen to be. The origin of this behavior can 
 be traced to the parabolic character of Fourier's law, which implies that the heat flow 
 starts (vanishes) simultaneously with the appearance (disappearance) of a 
 temperature gradient. Although Ï„ is very small for phono n-electron, and phonon-
  4phonon interaction at room temperature (10-11 and 10-13 seconds, respectively), 
 neglecting it is the source of difficulties, a nd in some cases a bad approximation as for 
 example in superfluid Heli um, and degenerate stars wh ere thermal conduction is 
 dominated by electrons -see [1 .3], for further examples. 
 In order to overcome this problem Cattane o and (independently) Vernotte by using 
 the relaxation time approximation to Boltzm ann equation for a simple gas derived a 
 generalization of  Fourier's law, namely [1.3] 
 T qtqâˆ‡ âˆ’ = +âˆ‚âˆ‚Îº Ï„GG
                                  (1.4) 
 This expression (known as Catt aneo-Vernotte's equation) leads to a hyperbolic equation 
 for the temperature (Heaviside equation) wh ich describes the prop agation of thermal 
 signals with a finite speed 
 Ï„Ï‡=v                                        (1.5) 
 This diverges only if the unphysical assumption of setting Ï„ to zero is made. 
 It is worth mentioni ng that a simple random walk an alysis of transport processes 
 naturally leads to H eaviside equation, not to the diff usion equation -see e.g. [1.4]. 
 Again, the latter is obtain ed only if one ne glects the second derivative term. 
 It is instructive to write (1.4) in the equivalent integral form

 i.e., Q describes the thermal memory of the mate rial by assigning di fferent weights to 
 temperature gradients at different moments in  the past. The Fourier law corresponds to 
 a zero-memory material (the only relevant temperature gradient is the "last" one, i.e., 
  5the one simultaneous with the appearance of q). By contrast the infinite memory case 
 (with Q = constant) leads to an undamped wave. Somewhere in the middle is the 
 Cattaneo-Vernotte equation, for which all temperature gradients contribute to q, but 
 their relevance goes down as we move to the past. 
 From these comments it should be clear that  different classes of  dissipative systems 
 may be described by different ke rnels. The one corr esponding to (1.4) being suitable for 
 the description of a restrict ed subclass of phenomena. 
 Obviously, when studying transient regimes, i.e., the evolution from a steady-state 
 situation to a new one, Ï„ cannot be neglected. In fact , leaving aside that parabolic 
 theories are necessarily non-ca usal, it is obvious that when ever the time scale of the 
 problem under consider ation becomes of the order of (or smaller) than the relaxation 
 time, the latter cannot be ignored. It is comm on sense what is at stake here: neglecting 
 the relaxation time amounts -in this situation- to di sregarding the whole problem under 
 consideration. Accord ing to a basic assumption underlyi ng the disposal of hyperbolic 
 dissipative theories, dissipative processes with relaxation times comparable to the 
 characteristic time of the system are out of the hydrodynamic regime. However, the 
 concept of hydrodynamic regime  involves the ratio between the mean free path of fluid 
 particles and the characteristic  length of the system. When th is ratio is lower that unity, 
 the fluid is within th e hydrodynamic regime. Wh en it is larger than  unity, the regime 
 becomes Knudsen's. In  the latter case the fluid is no longer a continuum and even 
 hyperbolic theories cease to be realiable. 
 Therefore that assumption can be valid onl y if the particles making up the fluid 
 are the same ones that transport the heat. Ho wever, this is never the case. Specifically, 
 for a neutron star, r is of the order of the scattering time between electrons (which carry 
 the heat) but this fact is not an obstacle (no matter how large the mean free path of 
 these electrons may be) to consider the neut ron star as formed by a Fermi fluid of 
 degenerate neutrons. The same is true for the second sound in superfluid Helium and 
 solids, and for almost any ordinary fluid. In brief, the hydrodynamic regime refers to 
 fluid particles that not necessarily (and as a matter of fact , almost never) transport the 
 heat. Therefore large relaxation times (large mean free paths of particles involved in 
 heat transport) does not imply a departur e from the hydrodynamic regime, but it is 
 usually overlooked). 
  6However, even in the case that the particles making up th e fluid are responsible of 
 the dissipative process, it is not "always" valid to take for granted that Ï„ and tc are of the 
 same order  or what comes to the sa me that the dimensionless quantity Î“ = (Ï„cs/L)2 is 
 negligible in all instances â€“ here cs stands for the adiabatic sp eed of sound in the fluid 
 under consideration and L the characteristic length of the system. That assumption 
 would be right if Ï„ were always comparable to tc and L always "large", but there are, 
 however, important situations in which Ï„ >> tc and L "small" although still large enough 
 to justify a macroscopic description. For tiny semiconductor pieces of about 10-4 cm in 
 size, used in common electronic devices submitted to high electric fields, the a bove 
 dimensionless combination (with Ï„ ~ 10~10 sec, c s ~ 107 cm/sec [1.3]) can easily be of 
 the order of unity. In ultras ound propagation as we ll as light-scattering experiments in 
 gases and neutron-scattering in  liquids the relevant length is no longer the system size, 
 but the wave  length A which is usually much smaller than L  Because of this, 
 hyperbolic theories may bear some importance in the study of nanoparticles and 
 quantum dots. Likewise m polymeric fluids relaxation times are related to the internal 
 configurational degrees of freedom and so much longer than tc (in fact they are in the 
 range of the minutes), and c a ~ 105 cm/sec, thereby Î“~1. In the degenerate core of 
 aged stars the thermal relaxation time can be as high as l second [1.2].  Assuming the 
 radius of the co re of about 10-2 times the solar radius, one has Î“~1 again. Fully ionized 
 plasmas exhibit a collisionless regime (Vlasov regime) for which the parabolic 
 hydrodynamics predicts a plasm on dispersion relation at va riance with the microscopic 
 results; the latter agree, however, with the hyperbolic hydrodynami c approach. Think for 
 instance of some syrup fluid flowing under a imposed shear stress, and imagine that the 
 shear is suddenly switched off.  This liquid will come to a ha lt only after a much longer 
 time (Ï„) than the collision time between its co nstituent particles has elapsed [1.2]. 
  
 1.2 High Energy Density Systems 
 The increase in light intensity  available in the laboratory over the previous 20 years 
 has been astounding. Laser peak power has climbed from gigawatts to petawatts in this 
 time span, and accessible focused intensity has increased by at least seven orders of 
 magnitude. Such a dramatic increase in light  brightness has accessed an entirely new set of 
 phenomena. High repetition rate table top lasers can routinely produce intensity in excess 
 of 10I9W/cm2, and intensities of up to 1020W/cm2 are possible with the latest petawatt class 
  7systems. Light-matter interac tions with single atoms are strongly non-pe rturbative and 
 electron energies are relativistic. The intrinsi c energy density of these focused pulses is 
 very high, exceeding a gigajoule per cm3. The interactions of such intense light with matter 
 lead to dramatic effects, such as high temperature plasma creation, bright X-ray pulse 
 generation, fusion plasma production, relativistic particle ac celeration, and highly charged 
 ion production [1.5]. 
 Such exotic laser-matter interactions have led to  an interesting set of applications in high 
 field science, and high energy de nsity physics (HED phy sics). These applications span basic 
 science and extend into unexpected new ar eas such as fusion en ergy development and 
 astrophysics. In this paper some of these new applications w ill be reviewed. The topics 
 covered here do not represent a comprehensive lis t of applications made possible with high 
 intensity short pulse lasers , but they do give a flavor of the diverse areas affected by the latest 
 laser technology. Most of the applications discussed here  are based on recent experiments 
 using lasers with peak power of 5-100 TW. Many important leaps in laser technology have 
 driven the rapid advances in  HED and high field science over the last 15 years. The 
 enabling advancement for this technological progress was the inven tion of chirped pulse 
 amplification (CPA) lasers. 
 The physics accessible with this class of lasers is quite extreme. The science 
 applications made possible with these extr emes can be simply classified into two 
 categories. First, by temporally compressing the pulses and focusing to spots of a few 
 wavelengths in diameter, these lasers concentrate energy in a very small volume. A 
 multi-TW laser focused to a few microns has an intrinsic energy density of over 109 
 J/cm3. This corresponds to about l0 keV of energy  per atom in a material at solid density. 
 As a result, quite high temperatures can be obtained. Such energy density corresponds to 
 pressure in excess of l0 Gbar. Many applicat ions of ultraintense lasers stem from the 
 ability to concentrate energy to high energy- density which can lead to quite extreme 
 states of matter. 
 The second class of applications  arises from the high field strengths associated with a 
 very intense laser pulse. At an intensity of over 1018 W/cm2, an intensity quite easily 
 achievable with modern table top terawatt lasers , the electric field of the laser exceeds ten 
 atomic units, over 1010 V/cm. Consequently, the strong fi eld rapidly  ionizes the atoms 
 and molecules during a few laser cycles. At intensity approaching 1021 W/cm2, the 
 current state of the art with petawatt class lasers, the electric field is comparable to the 
  8field felt by a K-shell electron in mid Z el ements such as argon. The magnetic field is 
 nearly 1000 T. An electron quivering in such a strong electric field will be accelerated to 
 many MeV of energy in a single optical cycle.  Such charged particles will experience a 
 very strong forward directed force re sulting from the Lorentz force [1.5]. 
 High peak power femtosecond lasers are unique in their ability to concentrate energy 
 in a small volume. A dramatic consequence of this concentration of energy is the ability 
 to create matter at high temperature and pressure. Matter with temperature and density 
 near the center of dense stars can be created in the laboratory with the latest high intensity 
 lasers. For example, solid density matter can be heated to temperature of over 106 C > 1 
 keV. Under these conditions, the particle pres sure inside the sample is over 1 billion 
 atmospheres, far higher than any other pre ssure found naturally on or in the earth and 
 approaches pressures created in nuclear  weapons and inertial confinement fusion 
 implosions. 
 Study of the properties of matter at these ex treme conditions, namely solid density or 
 higher in the temperature range of 1 â€“ 1000 eV , is crucial to unders tanding many diverse 
 phenomenon, such as the structure of planet ary and stellar interiors or how controlled 
 nuclear fusion implosions (inertial confinemen t fusion or ICF) evolve. Yet, despite the 
 wide technological and astrophysical applications, a true, complete understanding of 
 matter in this regime is not in hand. A large obstacle is posed by the fact that theoretical 
 models of this kind of matter are difficult to  formulate. While the atoms in these warm 
 and hot dense plasmas are strongly ionized, th e very strong coupling of the plasma, and 
 continuum lowering in the plasma dramatical ly complicates traditional plasma models 
 which depend on two body collisio n kinetics. Even the questio n of whether electrons in 
 this state are free or bound is not as cl ear cut as it is in a diffuse plasma. 
  
 1.3.  High Energy Density Heat Tran sport and Special Relativity Theory  
 In the interaction of laser beam with thin solid target, fast ion beams and electrons 
 are generated with large density. When the en ergy of laser beam is highly enough the ion 
 and electron velocities are relativistic and tr ansport of thermal energy must be described 
 by relativistic equations. In the paper [1.6 ] we develop the desc ription of the heat 
 transport in Minkowski spacetime. In the contex t special relativity theory we investigate 
 the Fourier equation and hyperbolic diffusion equation. We calculate the speeds of the 
 heat diffusion in Fourier approximation and show  that for high energy laser beam the heat 
  9diffusion exceeds the light velocity. We show th at this results breaks the causality of the 
 thermal phenomena in Minkowski spacetime. Th e same phenomena we describe in  the 
 framework of hyperbolic heat diffusion equatio n and show that in that case speed of 
 diffusion is always smaller than light velocity. 
 We may use the concept that the speed of light in vacuo  provides an upper limit on 
 the speed with which a signal can  travel between two events to establish whether or not 
 any two events could be connected. In the inte rest of simplicity we shall work with one 
 space dimension x1 = x and the time dimension xo = ct  of the Minkowski spacetime. 
 Let us consider events (1) a nd (2): their Minkowski interval Î”s satisfies the 
 relationship: 
              (1.9) 2 2 2 2x t c sÎ” âˆ’ Î” = Î”
 Without  loss of generality we take Event 1 to be at x = 0, t  = 0. Then Event 2 can be 
 only related to Event 1 if it is possible for a signal traveling at the speed of light, to 
 connect them. Event 2 is at ( Î”x, cÎ” t), its relationship to Event 1 depends on whether Î”s > 
 0, = 0, or < 0. 
 We may summarize  these three possibilities as follows: 
 Case A   timelike  interval, t c xAÎ” < Î”, or . Event 2 can be related to Event  02> Î”s
                1, events 1 and 2 can be in causal relation. 
 Case B lightlike interval , t c xBÎ” = Î”, or . Event 2 can only be related to  02= Î”s
                  Event 1 by a light signal. 
 Case C spacelike interval t c xAÎ” > Î”, or . Event 2 cannot be related to  02< Î”s
                  Event 1, for in that case c>Ï… . 
 Now let us consider the case C in more details. At first sight it seems that in case C 
 we can find out the reference frame in which two Events c> and c< always fulfils the 
 relations > 0. but it is not true. For lest us choose the inertial frame Uâ€™ in which

 where 
  mD==             ( 1 . 1 4 )

 theory and causality is not broken in dependently of laser beam energy. 
 When the amplitude of the laser beam a pproaches the critical electric field of 
 quantum electrodynamics (Schwinger field [1 .9]) the vacuum becomes polarized and 
 electron â€“ positron pairs are created in vacuum [1.9]. On a distance equal to the Compton 
 length, c me C= = , the work of critical field on an el ectron is equal to the electron rest

 of nonlinear quantum electrodynamics plays a key role: laser beams excite virtual 
 electron â€“ positron pairs. As a result the vacuum acquires a finite electric and magnetic 
 susceptibility which lead to the scattering of light by light. The cross section for the

 Non-Fourier description of laser - matter interaction 
  
 2.1 Fundamentals of laser pul ses interaction with matter 
 In this paragraph we will study the ultra-short thermal processes in the framework of 
 the hyperbolic diffusion equation. 
 When an ultrafast thermal pulse (e.g. femtosecond pulse) interacts with a metal 
 surface, the excited electrons become the main carriers of the thermal energy. For a 
 femtosecond thermal pulse, the duration of the pul se is of the same order as the electron 
 relaxation time. In this case, the hyperbolicit y of the thermal ener gy transfer plays an 
 important role [2.1]. 
 Radiation deposition of energy in materials is a fundamental phenomenon to laser 
 processing. It converts radiati on energy into materialâ€™s inte rnal energy, which initiates 
 many thermal phenomena, such as heat pulse  propagation, melting and evaporation. The 
 operation of many laser techniqu es requires an accurate under standing and control of the 
 energy deposition and transport processe s. Recently, radiation deposition and the 
 subsequent energy transport in metals have  been investigated with picosecond and 
 femtosecond resolutions. Results show that during high-power a nd short-pulse laser 
 heating, free electrons can be heated to an  effective temperature much higher than the 
 lattice temperature, which in turn leads to  both a much faster en ergy propagation process 
 and a much smaller lattice-temperature rise than those predicted from the conventional 
 radiation heating model. Corkum et al. [2.2] found that th is electron-lattice 
 nonequilibrium heating mechanism can si gnificantly increase the resistance of 
 molybdenum and copper mirrors to thermal da mage during high-power laser irradiation 
 when the laser pulse duration is  shorter than one nanosecond. Clemens et al. [2.3] studied 
 thermal transport in multilayer metals duri ng picosecond laser heating. The measured 
 temperature response in the first 20 ps was foun d to be different from predictions of the 
 conventional Fourier model. Due to the relatively low temporal resolution of the 
  16experiment (~ 4 ps), however, it is difficult to determine whether this difference is the 
 result of nonequilibrium laser heating or is  due to other heat conduction mechanisms, 
 such as non-Fourier heat conduction, or refl ection and refraction of thermal waves at 
 interfaces. Heat is conducted in solids through electrons and phonons. In metals, 
 electrons dominate the heat conduction, while in  insulators and se miconductors, phonons 
 are the major heat carriers. Table 2.1 lists  important features of the electrons and 
 phonons.

 The traditional thermal science, or macroscale heat transfer, employs 
 phenomenological laws, such as Fourierâ€™s law, without considering the detailed motion 
 of the heat carriers. Decreasing dimensions , however, have brought an increasing need 
 for understanding the heat  transfer processes from the microscopic point of view of the 
 heat carriers. The response of the electron and phonon gases to the external perturbation 
 initiated by laser irradiation can  be described with the help of a memory function of the 
 system. To that aim, let us consider  the generalized Fourier law [2.1]:

 where q(t) is the density of a thermal energy flux, T(tÂ´) is the temperature of  electrons 
 and K(t â€“ tÂ´ ) is a memory function for thermal pro cesses. The density of thermal energy 
 flux satisfies the following e quation of heat conduction:

 constant volume. We introduce the following equation for the memory function

 gas. In the case of a ve ry weak interaction, m â†’ m* and F 0Sâ†’ 0, so according to Eq.

 To sum up, we can make a statement that  for the case of weak electron-electron

 thermal disturbance propagation s. From this we conclude that the hyperbolic equation 
 for heat conduction Eq. (2.20), is identical  as the equation for second sound propagation

  20The mathematical analysis of Eq. (2.23)  leads to the following conclusions:

 Equation (2.26) describes propaga tion of the thermal wave in the electron gas. From the 
 point of view of theoretical physics, condition vS â†’ âˆž violates the special theory of 
 relativity. From this theory we know that there is a limited velocity of interaction 
 propagation and this velocity v lim = c, where c is the velocity of light in a vacuum. 
 Multiplying both sides of Eq. (2.24) by c2, we obtain

 heat conduction equation, which satisfies the special theory of relativity, acquires the 
 form of the partial hyperbolic Eq. (2.28). Th e rejection of the first component in Eq. 
 (2.28) violates the special theory of relativity.

 In order to clarify the physical meaning of the solutions given by formulas (2.35) and 
 (2.36), we observe that vÂ´ = v/Î»  and w1 and w 2 can be written as:

 where Ï‰ denotes the pulsation of the initial ther mal wave. From formula (2.37), it can be 
 concluded that we can define the ne w effective thermal wave velocities v1 and v 2. 
 Considering formulas (2.36) and (2.37), we obs erve that the thermal wave with velocity 
 v2 is very quickly attenuated in time. It occurs that when Ï‰-1 > 2Ï„ , the scatterings of the 
 heat carriers diminish the thermal wave. 
 It is interesting to observe that in the lim it of a very short relaxation time, i.e., when 
 Ï„â†’ 0, v 2 â†’ âˆž, because for Ï„ â†’ 0 Eq. (2.29) is the F ourier parabolic equation. 
 It can be concluded, that for Ï‰-1 > 2Ï„ , the Fourier equation is relevant equation for 
 the description of the thermal phenomena in metals. For Ï‰-1 > 2Ï„, the scatterings are 
 slower than in the preceding case and attenuati on of the thermal wave is weaker. In that 
 case,  Ï„  â‰  0 and v1 is always finite:

 For Ï„ â†’ 0, i.e., for very rare scatterings v1 â†’ v and Eq. (2.29) is a nearly free thermal 
 wave equation. For Ï„ finite the v1 < v and thermal wave propagates in the medium with 
 smaller velocity than the veloci ty of the initial thermal wave. 
  23Considering the formula (2.35), one can define  the change of the phase of the initial

 2.3. Quantum heat transport equation 
 Dynamical processes are commonly inve stigated using laser pump-probe 
 experiments with a pump pulse exciting the sy stem of interest and a second probe pulse 
 tracking is temporal evolution. As the time resolution attainable in such experiments 
 depends on the temporal definition of the laser pulse, pulse compression to the attosecond 
 domain is a recent promising development. 
 After the standards of time and space were  defined the laws of classical physics 
 relating such parameters as distance, time,  velocity, temperature are assumed to be 
 independent of accuracy with which these pa rameters can be measured. It should be 
 noted that this assumption doe s not enter explicitly into the formulation of classical 
  26physics. It implies that together  with the assumption of existe nce of an object and really 
 independently of any measurements (in clas sical physics) it was tacitly assumed that 
 there was a possibility of an unlimited in crease in accuracy of measurements.  Bearing in 
 mind the â€œatomicityâ€ of time i.e. considering the smallest time period, the Planck time, 
 the above statement is obviously not true. Atto second laser pulses we are at the limit of 
 laser time resolution. 
 With attosecond laser pulses belong to a new Nano â€“ World where size becomes 
 comparable to atomic dimensions, where tr ansport phenomena follow different laws from 
 that in the macro world. This firs t stage of miniaturization, from 10-3 m to 10-6 m is over 
 and the new one, from 10-6 m to 10-9 m just beginning. The Nano â€“ World is a quantum 
 world with all the predicable a nd non-predicable (yet) features. 
 In this paragraph, we develop and solve the quantum relativis tic heat transport 
 equation for nanoscale transport phenomena where external forces exist [2.9]. In 
 paragraph 2.1 we developed the new hype rbolic heat transport equation which 
 generalizes the Fourier heat transport equa tion for the rapid thermal processes. The 
 hyperbolic heat transport equation (HHT) for the fermionic system has be written in the 
 form (2.23)

 In what follows we develop the new formulation of the HHT, considering the details 
 of the two fermionic systems: electron gas in metals and the nucleon gas.

 2.4. Proca  thermal equation 
 It is quite interesting that the Proca  type equation can be obtained for thermal 
 phenomena. In the following starting with the hyperbolic heat diffusion equation the 
 Proca  equation for thermal processes will be developed and solved [2.9]. 
  31In paper [2.9] the relativistic hyperbo lic transport equation was developed:

 In equation (2.91) v is the velocity of heat waves, m0 is the mass of heat carrier and Î³  â€“ 
 the Lorentz factor, ()21
 221âˆ’âˆ’ =cvÎ³ . As was shown in paper [2.9] the heat energy ( heaton 
 temperature ) Th can be defined as follows: 
                       (2.92) .2
 0v m ThÎ³=
 Considering that v, the thermal wave velocity equals [2.9] 
  v = Î± c                     (2.93) 
 where Î± is the coupling constant for the interactions which generate the thermal wave  (Î± 
 = 1/137 and Î± = 0.15 for electromagnetic and strong forces respectively). The heaton 
 temperature  is equal to 
  .

 Î±Î±
 âˆ’=c mTh                     (2.94) 
 Based on equation (2.94) one concludes that the heaton temperature  is a linear 
 function of the mass m0 of the heat carrier. It is interesting to observe that the 
 proportionality of Th and the heat carrier mass m0 was observed for the first time in 
 ultrahigh energy heavy ion reactions measured  at CERN [2.10]. In paper [2.10] it was 
 shown that the temperature of pions, kaons  and protons produced in Pb+Pb, S+S 
 reactions are proportional to the mass of par ticles. Recently, at Rutherford Appleton 
 Laboratory (RAL), the VULCAN  LASER was used to produce the elementary particles: 
 electrons and pions [2.11]. 
 In this chapter the forced relativistic he at transport equation will be studied and 
 solved. In the case of the forced heat transpor t the master equation is of the form [2.1]:

  32It is worthwhile noting that in order to obtain a non-relativist ic equation we put Î³ = 1. 
 When the external force is present F(x,t)  the forced damped heat transport is obtained 
 instead of equation (2.96) (in one dimensional case):

 which is essentially the free Proca  equation. 
  33The Proca  equation describes the interaction of the laser pulse with the matter. As 
 was shown in paper [2.1] the quantization of the temperature field leads to the heatons  â€“ 
 quanta of thermal energy with a mass 2
 hhvmÏ„==  [2.1], where Ï„ is the relaxation time 
 and vh is the finite velocity for heat propagation. For vh â†’ âˆž, i.e. for c â†’ âˆž, mo â†’ 0. it 
 can be concluded that in non-relativistic approximation ( c = infinite) the Proca  equation 
 is the diffusion equation for massless photons and heatons.

 equation. The condition q = 0 can be rewritten as: 
  8==Ï„V                  (2.108) 
 The equation (2.108) is the analogous to the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. Considering 
 equation (2.92) equation (2 .108) can be written as: 
  .                ,8hhT VTV < =                (2.109) 
 It can be stated that distortion-le ss waves can be generated only if Th > V.  For Th < V, i.e. 
 when the â€œHeisenberg ruleâ€ is broken, the shape of the thermal waves is changed. 
 In this chapter we developed the relativistic thermal transport equation for an 
 attosecond laser pulse interaction with matter. It is shown that the equation obtained is 
 the Proca  equation, well known in relativistic electrodynamics for massive photons. As 
 the heatons  are massive particles th e analogy is well founded. Considering that for an 
 attosecond laser pulse the damped term in  Eq. (2.108) tends to 1, the transport 
 phenomena are well described by the Proca  equation.

 Time delayed processes in biophysics 
  
 3.1. Clusters and aggregates of atoms 
 Clusters and aggregates of atoms in the nanometer range (currently called 
 nanoparticles) are systems intermediate in several respects, between simple molecules 
 and bulk materials and have been the subject of intensive work. 
 In this paragraph, we investigate the ther mal relaxation phenomen a in nanoparticles â€“ 
 microtubules within the frame of the quantum he at transport equation. In reference [3.1], 
 the thermal inertia of materials, heated with laser pulses faster than the characteristic 
 relaxation time was investigated. It was shown,  that in the case of the ultra-short laser 
 pulses it was necessary to use the hyperbolic  heat conduction (HHC). For microtubules 
 the diameters are of the order of the de Brogl ie wave length. In that case quantum heat 
 transport must be used [3.1] to describe the transport phenomena,

 the relaxation time. The relaxation time Ï„ is defined as [3.1]

  37characterizes completely the thermal energy  transport on the atomic scale and can be 
 termed â€œatomic relaxation timeâ€ and â€œatomicâ€ heat diffusivity. 
 Both Ï„ and v h contain constants of Nature, Î±, c. Moreover, on an atomic scale there is 
 no shorter time period than and smaller veloc ity than that build from of constants in 
 Nature. Consequently, one can call Ï„ and v h the elementary relaxation time and elementary 
 diffusivity, which characterizes heat transport in th e elementary building  block of matter, 
 the atom. In the following, starting with elementary Ï„ and vh, we shall describe thermal 
 relaxation processes in microtubules which consist of the N components (molecules) 
 each with elementary Ï„ and v h. With this in view, we use the Pauli-Heisenberg 
 inequality [3.1] 
  ,31
 =N p râ‰¥ Î” Î”                (3.4) 
 where r denotes the characteristic dimens ion of the nanoparticle and p is the 
 momentum of the energy carriers. The Pauli- Heisenberg inequality expresses the basic 
 property of the N â€“ fermionic system. In fact, compared to the standard Heisenberg 
 inequality  
 ,=â‰¥ Î” Î”p r                 (3.5) 
 we observe that, in this case the presence of the large number of identical fermions forces 
 the system either to become spatially more extended for a fixed typical momentum 
 dispension, or to increase its typical mome ntum dispension for a fixed typical spatial 
 extension. We could also say that for a fermi onic system in its ground state, the average 
 energy per particle increases w ith the density of the system. 
 An illustrative means of interpreting the Pau li-Heisenberg inequality is to compare Eq. 
 (3.4) with Eq. (3.5) and to think of the qua ntity on the right hand side of it as the effective 
 fermionic Planck constant

 We could also say that antisymmetrization, which typifies fermionic amplitudes amplifies 
 those quantum effects which are aff ected by the Heisenberg inequality. 
 Based on equation (3.6), we can recalculate the relaxation time Ï„, equation (3.2) and

 3.2.  Quantum transp ort in microtubules 
  In paper [3.2] we develop the Klein - Gordon thermal equation for microtubules. 
 Microtubules are essential to cell functions. In neurons, micr otubules help and regulate 
 synaptic activity responsible for learning and cognitive function. Whereas microtubules 
 have traditionally been considered to be pur ely structural elements, recent evidence has 
 revealed that mechanical, chemical and el ectrical signaling and a communication function 
  39also exist as a result of the microtubule inte raction with membrane structures by linking 
 proteins, ions and voltage fi elds respectively. The characteristic dimensions of the 
 microtubules; a crystalline cyli nder 10 nm internal diameter, are of the order of the de 
 Broglie length for electrons in atoms. When the characteristic length of  the structure is of 
 the order of the de Broglie wave length, th en the signaling phenomena must be described 
 by the quantum transport theory. n order to describe quantum transport phenomena in 
 microtubules it is necessary to  use equation (3.14) with the relaxation time described as 
 follows:

 In the following we consider the time Ï„  for atomic and multiatomic phenomena. As

 The Penrose â€“ Hameroff Orchestrated Obje ctive Reduction Model (OrchOR) [3.3] 
 proposes that quantum superposition â€“ computat ion occurs in nanotubu le automata within 
 brain neurons and glia. Tubulin subunits with in microtubules act as qubits, switching 
 between states on a nanosec ond scale, governed by London  forces in hydrophobic 
 pockets. These oscillations are tuned and orch estrated by microtubule associated proteins 
 (MAPs) providing a feedback loop between the biological system and the quantum state. 
 These qubits interact computationally by no n-local quantum entanglement, according to 
 the Schr Ã¶dinger equation with preconscious proce ssing continuing until the threshold for 
 objective reduction (OR) is reached ) / (T E== . At that instant, collapse occurs, 
 triggering a â€œmoment of awarenessâ€ or a c onscious event â€“ an event that determines 
 particular configurations of Planck scal e experiential geometry and corresponding 
 classical states of nanotubules automata that re gulate synaptic and ot her neural functions. 
  40A sequence of such events could provide a fo rward flow of subjective time and stream of 
 consciousness. Quantum states in nanotubules may link to those in nanotubules in other 
 neurons and glia by tunne ling through gap functions,

 3.3. Heisenberg uncertainty prin ciple for thermal phenomena in

      We shall now develop the generalized quantum heat transport equation for 
 microtubules which also includes the potential term. Thus, we are able to use the anal ogy 
 of the SchrÂ¨odinger and quantum heat transport equations. If we consider, for the

 It is interesting to observe, th at condition (3.30) has an anal og in classical theory of the 
 electrical transmission line. In the context of the transmission of an electromagnetic field, 
 the condition q = 0 describes the Heaviside distor tionless line. Eq. (3.30) â€“ the 
 distortionless condition â€“ can be written as 
  ,0=â‰ˆÏ„V              ( 3 . 3 3 )  
 We can conclude, that in the presence of the potential energy V0 one can observe the 
 undisturbed quantum thermal wave  in microtubules only when the Heisenberg uncertainty 
 relation for thermal processes (3.33) is fulfilled. 
  The generalized quantum heat transport equation (GQHT) (3.23) leads to 
 generalized SchrÃ¶dinger equation for microtubules. After the substitution

 obtained, i.e. s  10 /17 2 2 âˆ’â‰ˆ < âˆ‡ c m tÎ±=

 4.1.   Introduction 
 The origins of European agriculture are normally sought in the Near East. The 
 earliest indicators of agriculture in the fo rm of cultivation of cereals and pulses are 
 rearing of animals come from Zagros footh ills. Their age, 11700 â€“ 8400 BC corresponds 
 to the cool dry climatic period followed by a rapid increase in rainfall at the beginning of 
 the Holocene (~ 10000 BC). 
 During the early stages of agricultural development (Preceramic Neolithic 9800 â€“ 
 7500 BC) the rapid increase in th e number of sites is noticeable in both the foothills and 
 the surrounding plains accompanied by the appearance of large settlements with complicated masonry structures a nd fortifications (e.g. Jericho). 
 At a later stage the core area of early agri cultural settlements shifts to the north to 
 the eastern highlands and inner depressions of Asia Minor. Th e most outstanding case of 
 early agricultural development in this area is Catal HÃ¼yÃ¼k, a Neolith ic town on the Konya 
 Plain (6500 â€“ 5700 BC). 
 The earliest sites with developed agricu ltural economies in Europe, dated 6400 â€“ 
 6000 BC are found in the intermontane depre ssions of Greece (Thessaly, Beotia and 
 Pelloponesse). Genetic features of  the cultigens and the genera l character of the material 
 culture leave no doubt to their Near â€“ Eastern origins. Significantly, the early Neolithic 
 sites in the Marmara Sea are of a more r ecent age (6100 â€“ 5600 BC), being culturally 
 distinct from the Early Neolithic in Greece. This implies that the Neolithic communities could penetrate the Balkan Peninsula from  Western Asia by means of navigation. 
  46The Neolithic spread further, plausibly via the Strouma axis in the northeast and the 
 Vardar â€“ Morava axis in the north. The en suing development saw a rapid growth of 
 Neolithic settlements in the depressions of northern Thrace the Lower and Middle 
 Danube catchment basin (5900 â€“ 5500 BC). 
 The next stage in the Neolithic development saw the emergence of new sites on the 
 Tisza Plain in 5600 â€“ 5500 BC [4.1]. 
 The new sites later spread over the vast areas  of the loess plains of Central Europe, 
 mostly along the Danube, Rhine â€“ Mainz and Vi stula axes. This spre ad occurred within 
 the range of 5600 â€“ 4800 BC within the most probable age of 5154 Â± 62 BC [4.2]. 
 Judging from the number of sites the populatio n in the Near East started increasing  
 ~ 15000 BC. Ammerman and Cavalli â€“ Sforza [4 .3] focused on measuring the rate of 
 spread of early farming in Europe  and derived the rate of spread v ~ 1 km/year on average 
 in Europe. The Danube and Rhine valleys the propagation paths had an increased 
 propagation speed as did the Me diterranean west [4.4]. The speeds of propagation of the 
 wave front v in these areas are as follows: 
 v = 1 km/year on average in Europe 
 v = 4 â€“ 6 km/year for the Danube â€“ Rhine valleys 
 v = 10 km/year for Mediterranean regions 
 Interpretations of these observations are usually based on the reaction â€“ diffusion 
 equation of population dynamics [4.5, 4.6]. Fo rt and MÃ©ndez [4.6, 4.7] discuss the front 
 propagation rate resulting from  the generalization of Fisher model, but their results are 
 restricted to the homogenous system. 
 The aim of this work is to formulate and develop a model for the spread of incipient 
 farming in Europe taking into account the en vironmental influences on the migration 
 processes. 
  
  
 4.2.  The model 
 Fick diffusion equation is a special case of  the parabolic transport equation in which 
 speed of perturbation propagati on is infinite. Parabolic transport equation has been 
 applied to the spread of advantageous gene s [4.8] dispersion of biological population 
 [4.9], epidemic models [4.10]. 
  47However if perturbation propa gates at finite speed, Fick  law does not hold [4.11]. 
 This unphysical feature can be  avoided by making use of h yperbolic transport equation 
 [4.11]. The hyperbolic propagation equation, HPE has been very recently applied to the 
 spread of epidemics [4.12], forest fire m odels [4.13] and chemical system [4.14]. 
 An interesting application of the Fick law to the migration in neolithic Europe was 
 presented in [4.15]. 
 Such a model as was presented in [4.15] provides a consistent explanation for the 
 origin of Indo â€“ European languages [4.16] an d also finds remarkable support from the 
 observed gene frequencies [4.17]. 
 In this paper we develop the model fo r the population migration following the 
 method presented in [4.11]. 
 Let n(x,t) stands for population density (measured in number of families per square 
 kilometer) where x is Cartesian coordinate and t is time. We assume that a well defined 
 time scale, Ï„ between two successive migration steps exists. The migrated population 
 interacts with environment. This in teraction we will model by potential V. in that case the 
 hyperbolic migration equation can be written as [4.11]:

 Considering Eq. (4.10) and Eq. (4.2) the solution of Eq. (4.1) can be written as: 
  ) , ( ) , (2t x u e t x ptÏ„âˆ’=             ( 4 . 1 1 )  
 where the u(x,t) is described by formula  (4.10). 
  As can be seen from formula (4.11) the general solution of Eq. (4.1) is the sum of 
 the wave motion described by the term  
  492) ( ) (vt x f vt x f+ + âˆ’ 
 and the lag term. 
  In conclusion one can say that the migration can be de scribed as the damped wave 
 motion which for  is going to diffusion of the population. âˆž â†’t
