 ABSTRACT
 We analyze the infrared (IR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 10Âµm<Î»rest<100Âµm forâˆ¼600
 galaxies at zâˆ¼0.7 in the extended Chandra Deep Field South by stacking their Spitzer24, 70 and 160Âµm
 images. We place interesting constraints on the average IR S EDshapein two bins: the brightest 25% of
 zâˆ¼0.7galaxiesdetectedat 24 Âµm,andtheremaining75%ofindividually-detectedgalaxies . Galaxieswithout

 the average IR SEDs of zâˆ¼0.7 star-forming galaxies fall within the diversity of zâˆ¼0 templates. While dust
 obscuration LIR/LUVseems to be only a function of star formation rate (SFR; âˆ¼LIR+LUV), not of redshift,
 the dust temperature of star-forming galaxies (with SFR âˆ¼10MâŠ™yrâˆ’1) at a given IR luminosity was lower at
 zâˆ¼0.7 than today. We suggest an interpretation of this phenomeno logyin terms of dust geometry: intensely
 star-forming galaxies at zâˆ¼0 are typically interacting, and host dense centrally-conc entrated bursts of star
 formation and warm dust temperatures. At zâˆ¼0.7, the bulk of intensely star-forming galaxies are relative ly
 undisturbedspirals and irregulars,and we postulate that t hey have large amountsof widespreadlower-density
 star formation,yielding lower dust temperaturesfor a give nIR luminosity. We recommendwhat IR SEDs are
 mostsuitableformodelingintermediateredshiftgalaxies withdiï¬€erentSFRs.

 1.INTRODUCTION
 Dusty, intensely star-forming galaxies (SFR >10MâŠ™yrâˆ’1)
 are the dominant contributors to the zâ‰¥0.5 cosmic SFR
 density(e.g.,Floreset al.1999;Elbazet al.2002;Pozzi et al.
 2004; Le Flocâ€™het al. 2005). The thermal dust emission
 from these galaxies accounts for much of the cosmic IR
 background, which contains half of the radiation energy of
 the extragalactic background light (Hauser&Dwek 2001;
 Lagacheet al.2005; Doleetal.2006). Thereforeunderstand -
 ingtheIRSEDsofthedustystar-forminggalaxiesisessenti al
 for mapping the evolution of star formation as a function of
 cosmic time, and is a key observationalingredient of our un-
 derstandingofgalaxyevolution.
 Detailed studies of the IR SEDs over the full range of
 3-1000Âµm have only been carried out for nearby galaxies
 (e.g., Daleet al. 2005), ï¬nding that the IR SED shape is cor-
 related with dust temperature (Soifer& Neugebauer 1991;
 Dale& Helou 2002; Chapmanet al. 2003; Lagacheetal.
 2003). Interestingly, despite this diversity of SED shapes ,
 local galaxiesâ€™ mid-IR (10-30 Âµm) luminosities are tightly
 correlated with their total IR luminosities with a scatter
 ofâˆ¼0.3dex (Chary&Elbaz 2001; Papovich& Bell 2002;
 Takeuchiet al.2005b; Daleet al.2005).
 Thislocalobservation has often been used as a key as-
 sumptioninstudiesexploitingdeepmid-IRimagingfromthe
 Infrared Space Observatory at 15Âµm and the Spitzer Space
 Telescope at24Âµm(e.g.,Floreset al.1999,2004;Zhengetal.

 6Department of Astronomy, Columbia University, New York,NY 100 272004; Hammeret al. 2005; Bell et al. 2005; Melbourneet al.
 2005). Such studies have found signiï¬cantly enhanced star
 formation at 0.5/lessorsimilarz/lessorsimilar1, compared to the present day.
 Yet, this conclusion rests critically on the extent to which
 mid-IR luminosities reï¬‚ect the total IR luminosity. Unfor-
 tunately, only a small fraction of mid-IR detected sources
 can be individually detected in the far-IR bands(e.g., Spitzer
 70 & 160Âµm), owing to limited signal-to-noise ratio (S /N)
 and source confusion (Doleet al. 2004b; Frayeret al. 2006).
 Thus, testing of this key assumption remains limited to the
 brightest sources (e.g., Sajinaet al. 2006; Borysetal. 200 6)
 or is indirect (e.g., Appletonet al. 2004; Yanet al. 2005;
 Popeet al. 2006;Marcillacet al.2006).
 Thegoalofthispaperis toexploretheaverageIRSEDsof

 have shown that stacking noise-limited images of a set of
 galaxies allows one to securely detect the mean ï¬‚ux of the
 galaxy set substantially below the individual detection li mit
 (Zhenget al.2006;Doleet al.2006). Here,westackatlonger

 lengths, to place constraints on the dust extinction and SED s

 we test the results of stacking noise and confusion limited

 the average SEDs. Discussion and conclusion are given in

 deep ultraviolet data from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer
 (GALEX: Martinet al. 2005a), optical data from the Classi-
 fying Objects by Medium-Band Observations (COMBO-17;
 Wolf etal. 2003) survey, and four band (3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and
 8.0Âµm)InfraredArrayCamera(IRAC;Fazioet al.2004)data
 to construct the stellar SED of a galaxy. These data cover
 wavelength range from 0.15 Âµm to 160Âµm in the observed
 frame, equal to the rest-frame range âˆ¼0.09 toâˆ¼100Âµm for
 z=0.7.

 The deep IRAC 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 Âµm imaging data and
 MIPS 24, 70 and 160 Âµm imaging data were obtained as
 part of the ï¬rst run of MIPS GTO observations (Rieke etal.
 2004). A rectangular ï¬eld of âˆ¼90â€²Ã—30â€²was observed in
 all bands (with small shifts between di ï¬€erent bands). The

 83ÂµJy(at80%completeness;seePapovichet al.2004forde-

 70Âµm image is characterized by a PSF of FWHM â‰ƒ18â€²â€²and
 a resolution of 9.â€²â€²9pixelâˆ’1. The 160Âµm image has a PSF of
 FWHMâ‰ƒ40â€²â€²and a resolution of 16â€²â€²pixelâˆ’1. Sources with
 ï¬‚uxes of f70>15mJy can be individually resolved at 70 Âµm
 and off160>50mJy at 160Âµm (see Doleet al. 2004a, for

 2.2.Thesamples
 We combine spectroscopic redshifts from the VLT VI-
 MOS Deep Survey (LeF` evreet al. 2005) and the GOODS
 survey (Vanzellaet al. 2005, 2006) with photometric red-
 shifts from the COMBO-17 survey (Wolf et al. 2004) to se-
 lect sample galaxies. The E-CDFS has HST imaging from
 the Galaxy EvolutionfromMorphologyand SEDs (Rixet al.
 2004, GEMS;) Survey. Visually classiï¬ed morphologies are
 available for 1458 galaxies with mR<24 in a thin redshift
 slicez=0.7Â±0.05 (Bell et al. 2005). Of the 1458 galaxies,
 1114galaxieshaveallobservations,includingGALEX,IRAC
 and MIPS observations. To avoid contamination from active
 galacticnuclei(AGNs),weremove22X-raydetectedsources

 ing a sample of 1092 galaxies. Spectroscopic redshifts are
 available for 64% of the sample galaxies. The contribution
 fromthe X-ray-undetectedAGNstothe total 24 Âµm luminos-
 ity ofz<1 galaxiesis suggestedto be <âˆ¼10% (Zhenget al.

 Accordingly,thecompletenessofthesample,intermsofste l-

 (old or dusty) galaxies is Mâˆ—âˆ¼1010MâŠ™whereas blue galax-

 to impose a stellar mass cut of Mâˆ—â‰¥1010MâŠ™in what fol-
 lows; not only are almost all 24 Âµm emitters above this mass
 cut, but also the completeness of this sample is not a strong
 function of color (i.e., age or dust obscuration). We also se -

 3.IMAGE STACKING
 As outlined earlier, current missions are unable to yield
 individual detections for the vast majority of intermediat e-
 redshiftobjectsatfar-IRwavelengths,owingbothtocontr ibu-
 tionsfrominstrumentalnoiseandconfusionnoise. Inorder to
 placeconstraintsontheshapeoftheIRSEDsofâ€˜typicalâ€™sta r-
 forming intermediate redshift galaxies, stacking on the po si-
 tions of known star-forming galaxies can lower the e ï¬€ective
 noise (Zhenget al. 2006), allowingdetectionof the â€˜averag eâ€™
 galaxy. In Zhenget al. (2006) we presented a description of
 stacking of 24Âµm data (in that case to resolve the 24 Âµm lu-
 minosity of dwarf galaxies); we brieï¬‚y summarize the most
 important aspects of 24 Âµm stacking inÂ§3.1. The focus of
 this paper is stacking at longer wavelengths, at 70 Âµm (PSF
 FWHM 18â€²â€²) and160Âµm (FWHM40â€²â€²),discussedinÂ§3.2.
 3.1.FUV,NUV andMIPS24 Âµm imagestacking
 Whilemuchofthispaperdescribesstackingresultsforsub-
 samples that are individually detected at 24 Âµm, some sub-
 samples are not individually detected at 24 Âµm. Further-
 more, the 24Âµm, FUV and NUV images share many of the
 same characteristics: the PSFs have similar FWHM, and at
 each wavelength,/greaterorsimilar1/2 of the extragalactic background at
 that wavelength is resolved by these images (i.e., the image s
 are only mildly confusion-limited;e.g., Papovichetal. 20 04;Xuetal. 2005; Doleet al. 2006). Accordingly, stacking of
 FUV, NUV and 24 Âµm images is carried out in the same way
 (seeZhenget al.2006, formoredetails).
 Threebasic steps are adoptedto derive the mean ï¬‚uxesfor
 galaxy subsets. First, we subtract all individually-detec ted
 sources from the images. This is done using the software
 tool STARFINDER7(Diolaitiet al. 2000) with an empiri-
 cal PSF constructed from 18 /42/56 bright point sources at
 24Âµm/FUV/NUV respectively. Then we performmean stack
 of the residual image postage stamps centered on the opti-
 calcoordinatesoftheobjectsthatareindividuallyundete cted
 in the subset of interest. An aperture of 5â€²â€²is used to in-
 tegrate the central ï¬‚ux of the mean-stacked image and esti-
 matethebackgroundfromtheouterregions. Aperturecorrec -
 tions of a factor of 1.88 /1.19/1.14, derived from the empiri-
 cal PSF at 24Âµm/FUV/NUV respectively,are adoptedto cal-
 ibrate the stacked ï¬‚uxes to the total ï¬‚uxes. Last we sum the
 ï¬‚uxes of individually-detected sources and the stack ï¬‚ux of
 individually-undetectedsourcesineachgalaxysubset,gi ving
 the mean 24Âµm/FUV/NUV ï¬‚uxes. Uncertainties are derived
 frombootstrapping.
 3.2.MIPS70and160Âµm imagestacking
 The 70Âµm and 160Âµm PSFs are considerably larger than
 those at shorter wavelengths, yielding confused images, re -
 solving only the brightest, relatively nearby sources â€” som e
 <30% of the extragalactic background at this wavelength
 (Doleet al. 2004a). Galaxies at 0 .6<z<0.8 are heav-
 ily confused in all but the brightest cases (Doleetal. 2004a ;
 7STARFINDER gives identical results within the errors to the tool ALL-
 STARin IRAF package.4 Zhengetal.

 The ï¬‚uxes were taken from the 8255 individually-resolved so urces in theâˆ¼1.â—¦5Ã—0.â—¦5 24Âµm image and were split into 18 ï¬‚ux bins in the range from 83 ÂµJy to
 10mJy. Thenumber of objects in each bin decreases with incre asing ï¬‚ux. Threemeasures of thestack ï¬‚ux arepresented for e ach bin: the integrated central ï¬‚ux
 of themeanstack using the meanbackground for sky subtraction; the integrated central ï¬‚ux of themeanstack using the medianbackground; and the integrated
 central ï¬‚ux of the medianstack using the medianof the background (see text for details). Errorbars are deri ved from bootstrapping. While the ï¬‚ux can be
 recovered with little bias at 70 Âµmresolution, ï¬‚ux recovery at160 Âµmleads to asystematic overestimate.

 2006).
 Thelargeangularextentofthelong-wavelengthPSFsposes
 a signiï¬cant challengefor those wishing to estimate their a v-
 erage properties. At z=0.7, the PSF size of the 70 Âµm image
 (FWHMâ‰ƒ18â€²â€²) correspondsto a physicalscale of âˆ¼130kpc.
 For the 160Âµm image (PSF FWHM â‰ƒ40â€²â€²), the correspond-
 ing scale isâˆ¼290kpc. Thus, the stacking results are a re-
 ï¬‚ection of the IR-luminosity weighted two-point correlati on
 functionon/greaterorsimilar100kpcscales, overestimatingthetrueaverage
 ï¬‚uxesofthegalaxiesofinterest.
 In order to understand this source of systematic error in
 better detail, we carried out some simulations where syn-
 thetic 24Âµm data (using the observed positions and ï¬‚uxes
 of individually-detected 24 Âµm sources) are degraded in res-
 olution to the resolution of the 70 Âµm and 160Âµm data. For
 the purposesof this test, we assume a constant ratio between
 24Âµm ï¬‚ux and the wavelength of interest. We explore two
 cases. First, the positions are randomly scrambled (i.e., t he
 relative brightnesses of galaxies are preserved but their p osi-
 tions are random). This test gives an indication of the sys-
 tematic eï¬€ects of stacking randomly-positionedsources. The
 second case is when both the ï¬‚uxes and positions of sources
 are preserved. This second case is our â€˜bestâ€™ estimate of the
 likely systematic uncertainties of stacking in a realistic ally-
 clustered case. Figure 2 shows the 24 Âµm images degraded
 to the 70 and 160Âµm resolution respectively, compared with
 the observed MIPS 24, 70 and 160 Âµm images. Because of
 confusion, only a handful of bright 24 Âµm sources can be in-
 dividuallyresolvedinthedegradedimages. Throughstacki ngthe mean ï¬‚ux can be estimated for 24 Âµm source subsets; the
 accuracy of the recovery of the mean ï¬‚ux shows how well
 stackingworksat thatcorrespondingimageresolution.
 3.2.1.Stackingrandomly distributedsources
 The whole 24Âµm mosaic image of the E-CDFS covers
 a rectangular sky area of âˆ¼1.â—¦5Ã—0.â—¦5 and contains 8255
 individually-detected sources at 5 Ïƒdetection limit (83 ÂµJy).
 Thevastmajorityofthe8255sources( f24>83ÂµJy)arepoint
 sources. Replacing all sources with the 24 Âµm PSF (empiri-
 callyconstructedfrombrightstars),wegeneratedanartiï¬ cial
 24Âµm image having the 8255 sources randomly distributed
 into aâˆ¼1.â—¦5Ã—0.â—¦5 blank ï¬eld. The artiï¬cial 24 Âµm image
 was then degraded to the 70 and 160 Âµm image resolution
 respectively. The degraded images are then stacked at the
 24Âµm source positions, giving indications as to the expected
 quality of stacking results at 70 Âµm and 160Âµm. We note
 that the replacement of the background blank ï¬eld with the
 PSF-subtracted24 Âµm image(havingsomecontributionfrom
 individually-undetectedsources) does not modify our resu lts
 signiï¬cantlyinthemean,addingonlysomemodestadditiona l

 The 24Âµm sources were sorted into 18 bins in ï¬‚ux, rang-
 ing from 83ÂµJy to 10mJy (see also Doleet al. 2006), with
 âˆ¼1000 objects per bin at faint ï¬‚ux levels, and /lessorsimilar100 per bin
 atbrighterï¬‚uxes. Thenumbersofsourcesandaverage24 Âµm

 to PSF-subtract out the individually-detected sources, st ack-
 ing the remaining image (in order to reduce bias from bright
 sources in backgroundestimates). In the real 70 and 160 Âµm
 images, we detect âˆ¼130 sources in each image. Thus, weInfraredSEDsof zâˆ¼0.7Star-FormingGalaxies 5

 For each ï¬‚ux bin, postage stamps were cut from the simu-

 each bin through averaging or medianing. For the stacked
 70Âµm postage stamp images, an aperture of radius 0 .â€²49 is
 used to integrate the central stack ï¬‚ux and an annulus with
 inner radius 0.â€²82 and outer radius 1 .â€²23 to estimate the back-
 ground. For the stacked 160 Âµm postage stamp images, the
 correspondingaperture is of radius 1 .â€²07 and the correspond-
 ing annulus is of inner radius 1 .â€²07 and outer radius 1 .â€²87.
 The mean and median of pixels in the annulus region were
 taken as the background of the mean-stacked image for sky
 subtraction. Only the median (nearly identical to the mean)
 wasadoptedasthe backgroundofthemedian-stackedimage.

 3.2.3.Stacking zâˆ¼0.7galaxies
 The above tests demonstrate that it will be di ï¬ƒcult to esti-
 matethemeanï¬‚uxat70 Âµmand160Âµmtobetterthanâˆ¼20%,
 and that the extent of the bias towards higher or lower ï¬‚ux
 is diï¬ƒcult to predict with accuracy. In this paper, we adopt
 a pragmatic approach: for each subsample that is stacked at
 70Âµm and 160Âµm, we attempt to derive an individual â€˜bias
 correctionâ€™ based on the 24 Âµm image. Sources bright at
 24Âµm are generally bright at 70 and 160 Âµm, although the
 24Âµm to 70 or 160Âµm ï¬‚ux ratio varies from object to object
 at a scatter at the 0.5dex level (Daleet al. 2005). Thus, we
 adopt the simplistic assumption that the 24 Âµm image can be
 takenasagoodproxyforthe70or160 Âµmimageatâ‰ƒ6â€²â€²res-
 olution and high S /N; 70Âµm and 160Âµm resolution images
 derived under this assumption (Fig. 2) appear a reasonable
 description of the real 70 Âµm and 160Âµm images. Thus, for
 a given subset of zâˆ¼0.7 galaxies, we estimated precisely
 the mean 24Âµm ï¬‚ux from their 24 Âµm images. Then we de-
 gradedthe 24Âµm imagesto 70 and 160 Âµm image resolution.
 Two stack ï¬‚uxes were estimated by stacking each of the two
 setsofdegradedimages. Bycomparingthestackï¬‚uxestothe
 actualmean24Âµmï¬‚uxofthegalaxysubset,weobtainedem-
 pirical corrections, which were applied to the correspondi ng
 70 and 160Âµm stack ï¬‚uxes of the subset of zâˆ¼0.7 galax-
 ies, respectively. Uncertainties in this correction are ap plied
 also, in quadrature, to the derived stacking results at 70 Âµm
 and160Âµm.

 of the total IR luminosity from the 24 Âµm luminosity is dis-
 cussed.
 4.1.TherelationshipbetweenIRSEDandmorphology
 We used a sample of 1092 galaxies of known morphology
 to investigate the dependence of the IR SED shape on mor-
 phology. The 1092 galaxies are classiï¬ed into three mor-
 phological types: elliptical /lenticular (E/S0), spiral, and ir-
 regular/peculiar. Figure 1 shows the relationshipbetweenthe
 rest-frame color Uâˆ’Vand stellar mass. Objects detected
 at 24Âµm (f24>83ÂµJy) are marked with open symbols and
 undetected ones with skeletal symbols. The detection limit
 of 83ÂµJy correspondsto the monochromaticobserved-frame
 24Âµm luminosityÎ½LÎ½,24=6Ã—1010LâŠ™atz=0.7. The24Âµm-
 undetectedgalaxiesareintrinsicallyfaintintheIRbands (see
 Â§4.2), and we excluded them in constructing these compos-
 ite SEDs. To avoid selection bias in color (see Â§2.2), we
 also excluded about one third of the 24 Âµm detected galaxies
 withMâˆ—<1010MâŠ™, leaving 152galaxiesin the ï¬nal sample.
 We calculated the average luminosities in 14 bands for each
 subsample of 24Âµm-detected galaxies: FUV & NUV from
 GALEX, U,B,V,RandIfromtheCOMBO-17survey,IRAC
 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 Âµm, MIPS 24, 70 and 160 Âµm bands.
 The average luminosity of each band includes contributions
 from both individually-detected and individually-undete cted
 sources (at wavelengths other than 24 Âµm). Errors in the av-
 erage luminosities were derived from bootstrapping, inclu d-
 ing contributionsto the uncertaintyfrom measurementerro rs

 undetectedï¬‚uxes. TheaverageSEDspansarangeintherest-
 frameof0.1to 100 Âµm.
 Figure 5 shows the average SEDs of the three subsam-
 ples. Each ofthe three averageSEDs is dominatedbya dust-
 extincted stellar spectrum at Î»<5Âµm and emission by dust
 atÎ»>5Âµm. Irregular/peculiar galaxies show a higher ratio
 of dust to stellar emission compared to the spirals and E /S0
 galaxies. The slope of the IR SED (rest-frame 10-100 Âµm)
 is steeper for irregular /peculiar galaxies, somewhat interme-
 diate for E/S0 galaxies, and lowest for spirals although the
 uncertaintiesof70and160 Âµm luminositiesarelarge. Their-InfraredSEDsof zâˆ¼0.7Star-FormingGalaxies 7

 regular/peculiargalaxies usually form stars in relatively con-
 centrated regions, leading to a high star formation intensi ty
 (i.e. SFRperunitarea). Incontrast,thespiralsareoftenc har-
 acterized by a relatively low star formation intensity as th e
 star-forming regions are widely distributed over disks. Th e
 star formation density for the E /S0 galaxies is somewhat be-
 tweenthoseoftheirregular /peculiargalaxiesandspirals. The
 shapes of the IR SEDs are thus a function of star formation
 intensity in the sense that the dust temperature is primaril y
 colder in systems of relatively lower star formation intens ity
 (wewill returnthistopicin Â§5).

 The sample galaxies were divided into three 24 Âµm lumi-
 nosity bins: L24-high,L24-medium and L24-low. The ï¬rst
 two bins contain 218 individually-detected 24 Âµm sources
 (f24>83ÂµJy) and all individually-undetected 24 Âµm sources
 (361 of the 579) are in the third bin. The L24-high bin is
 chosen to contain 58 brightest 24 Âµm sources so that its total
 24Âµm luminosity equals that of the L24-medium bin. Con-
 sequently the stacked 70 and 160 Âµm ï¬‚uxes are expected to

 The dust temperatureand IR luminosity increase for increas -
 ingf60/f100(e.g., Soifer&Neugebauer 1991). The average
 IR SEDs for zâˆ¼0.7 galaxies are determined by the three
 MIPS bands, corresponding to the rest-frame âˆ¼14,âˆ¼41 and
 âˆ¼94Âµm bands. The 24Âµm and 160Âµm luminosities can be
 takenasrest-frame15 Âµmand100Âµmluminosities,forwhich
 â€˜K-correctionsâ€™ are negligible. We estimated the rest-frame

 We compared our average SEDs with the IR SED model
 templates from Lagacheet al. (2004), Chary& Elbaz (2001)
 and Dale &Helou (2002). The three sets of templates were
 empiricallycalibratedtorepresentlocalstar-formingga laxies
 spanning a wide range in the IR ï¬‚ux ratio f60/f100. Dale &
 Helouâ€™s IR SED templates are characterized by the ï¬‚ux ra-
 tiof60/f100. We use the equationfromChapmanet al. (2003)
 to parameterize the IR luminosity (8 - 1000 Âµm) as a func-
 tion off60/f100.8The templates from Lagacheetal. (2004)
 and Chary&Elbaz (2001) were characterized by the IR lu-

 a resolution of 0.1dex. The observed IR SED of each subset

 As shown in Figure 8 the local SED templates track the
 observed SEDs reasonably well, in particular for the L24-
 medium bin, which contains the majority of intense star-
 forming galaxies. As the total IR luminosity is dominated
 by emission in the rest-frame wavelength range between 10
 and100Âµm,theestimatesofthetotalIRluminositywithtem-
 plates from diï¬€erent models give similar results. In contrast,
 Ï‡2is a measure of the shape agreement between a template
 and an observed SED. It is worth noting that the estimate of
 total IR luminosity based on the three measurements at 24,
 70 and 160Âµm is not sensitive to the shapes of the IR SED
 templates. Both the best-ï¬t luminosity match and the best-ï¬ t

 ing, the shape (or dust temperature) of the average IR SEDs
 of star-forming galaxies at zâˆ¼0.7 (i.e., the L24-high bin and
 L24-medium bin) are better ï¬tted by the local SED templates
 of characteristic IR luminosity LIRâ‰¤1011LâŠ™than those of

 4.4.The extrapolationfrom therest-frame15 Âµm to thetotal
 IRluminosity
 Local IR SED templates are often used to estimate the to-
 tal IR luminosities from single mid-IR band luminosities fo r
 distantstar-forminggalaxies. WiththeaveragedIRSEDsde -
 termined in the three MIPS bands, we are able to better con-
 strain the estimates of the IR luminosities. We compared the
 estimateswiththosetransformedfromsingle15 Âµmluminosi-
 tiesusinglocalSEDtemplates.
 By linearly integrating between the average 24, 70 and
 160Âµm luminosities(inlogarithmspace)forthestar-forming
 galaxies at zâˆ¼0.7, we estimated the rest-frame 12â€“100 Âµm
 luminosities. Uncertainties are calculated from the combi -
 nation of the uncertainties in the three bands. The total IR
 (the rest-frame 8â€“1000 Âµm) luminosity is derived from the
 three dust temperature-match templates to each observed IR
 SED (the 24, 70 and 160 Âµm). We combine the scatter be-
 tween the templates and the uncertainty in determining the
 dust temperature-matchtemplates, in which the uncertaint ies
 of the 24, 70and 160 Âµm luminositiesare counted,as the un-
 certainty for the total IR luminosity. The results are liste d
 in Table 2. For comparison, we use the NASA /IPAC Extra-
 galactic database (NED) to collect a sample of 29 local star-
 forminggalaxies( z<0.1)withobservationsat12,25,60and
 100Âµm byIRAS, at 15Âµm by ISO and at least in one band
 longerthan 100Âµm. The 12â€“100Âµm luminosityand the total
 IRluminosityarecalculatedasabove. Whenobservationsdo
 not reach 1000Âµm, a modest (/lessorsimilar20% of the IR luminosity)
 extrapolationis employedusingthelocalSED templates.
 Figure 9 shows the extrapolations(bolometric corrections )
 from the rest-frame 15 Âµm to the 12â€“100Âµm luminosity (left
 plot) and to the total IR luminosity (right plot) as function s
 of the IR ï¬‚ux ratio f60/f100. The local star-forming galax-
 iesexhibitasigniï¬cantscatter(Chary& Elbaz2001;seeals o
 Daleet al. 2005); such scatter is typically adoptedas the sy s-
 tematic uncertainty of template-based estimates of total I R
 luminosity from rest-frame mid-IR luminosity. The zâˆ¼0.7
 star-forming galaxies distribute within the scatter of the lo-
 cal star-forming galaxies. Again, there is a tendency for th e
 zâˆ¼0.7 galaxies to cluster towards the colder templates, sug-
 gesting that use of spiral galaxy templates for extrapolati on
 oftotalIRluminosityfromintermediateredshift24 Âµmï¬‚uxes
 gives a more accurate result than the use of starburst /LIRG
 templates.
 4.5.Dust extinction
 A universal relation between SFR and dust extinction is
 suggested by several studies at z<1 (Hopkinset al. 2001;
 Adelberger&Steidel2000;Bell 2003;Takeuchiet al.2005a;
 Zhengetal. 2006; Buat etal. 2006; althoughsee Reddyetal.
 2006 for a dissenting view at zâˆ¼2). With a measured esti-
 mateofthetotalIRluminosityfromthe24,70and160 Âµmlu-
 minosities,weexploretherelationshipbetweenSFRanddus t
 extinction at zâˆ¼0.7, comparing it to that at zâˆ¼0. The dust
 extinction is described by the IR to UV ratio LIR/LUV. The
 UV luminosity, i.e., the integrated luminosity between res t-
 frame 1500-2800Ã…, is estimated from linear interpolation o f

 5.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
 We selected a sample of 152 galaxies in the redshift slice
 0.65â‰¤zâ‰¤0.75 of known morphology from HST imag-
 ing and another sample of 579 mass-limited ( Mâˆ—â‰¥1010MâŠ™)
 galaxies in the redshift slice 0 .6<z<0.8 to study the IR
 SEDsatthatredshift. Wedividedoursamplegalaxiesintodi f-
 ferent mass-limited morphology and 24 Âµm luminosity bins.
 For each bin, we determined the average luminosities in 14
 bands from the FUV to the FIR by summing the individual
 detectionsandaddinginthestackedï¬‚uxfromnon-detection s.

 minedfrom the 24 Âµm image, were introducedto accountfor
 theclusteringeï¬€ectsonthe stackresults.
 The average luminosities in three MIPS bands determine
 the IR SED from the rest-frame 10 to 100 Âµm. Our principal
 result is that the average IR SED shape of zâˆ¼0.7 intensely

 templates to extrapolate total IR luminosity from observed -

 terized by colder dust emission than their local counterpar ts
 ofcomparableIRluminosity.
 Previous studies have found evidence for a somewhat
 cooler dust SED at 0 .2<z<2.5 than for local galaxies of
 a comparable luminosity (e.g., Popeet al. 2006; Sajina etal .
 2006) at 0.2<z<2.5. These studies were selected in rest-
 frame>100Âµmemission,andtheauthorssuspectedthattheir
 overall tendency towards â€˜colderâ€™ IR SEDs was in part due
 to that long-wavelengthselection. Our sample is selected o n
 rest-frameâˆ¼15Âµm emission,i.e., bywarm dust; yet, we ï¬nd
 a â€˜colderâ€™ average SED at a given luminosity than is found
 locally. This tends to support the interpretation that the o ï¬€-
 set which we and others have found towards colder tempera-
 turesatagivenluminosityareatleastinpartarealdi ï¬€erence.
 We suggest that this tendency toward colder dust tempera-
 turereï¬‚ects a diï¬€erencein dust andstar formationgeometry:

 disk-dominated, relatively undisturbed galaxies (Zhenge tal.
 2004; Bell et al. 2005; Melbourneet al. 2005). We suggest
 that these disk galaxies host widespread intense star forma -
 tion, like star formation in local spirals but scaled up, lea d-
 ing to relatively cold dust temperatures. This is consisten t
 with what Chanialetal. (2006) found â€” the scatter in the
 LIRâˆ’Tdustrelation for star-forming galaxies is largely in-
 duced by the size dispersion of the star-forming regions; an d
 the IR luminosity surface density Î£IRâˆ’Tdustrelation is morefundamental than the the LIRâˆ’Tdustrelation. We examined
 the IR ï¬‚ux ratio f60/f100(indicator of dust temperature) as
 a function of the IR luminosity surface density for zâˆ¼0.7
 star-forming galaxies. By taking galaxy size (i.e. half-li ght
 radius) derived from HST imaging (HÂ¨ auÃŸleret al. 2007) as
 a proxy of the size of star-forming regions in a galaxy and
 24Âµm luminosity as a proxy of total IR luminosity, we split
 a sample of 311 24 Âµm-detected galaxies in the redshift slice
 0.6<z<0.8 into two bins in the 24- Âµm luminosity surface
 densityÎ£L24. TheaverageSEDs forthetwo subsetsof galax-
 ieswereconstructedinthesamewayasdescribedin Â§4.1and
 shown in the inner panel of Figure 11. The total IR luminos-
 ity is estimated as log( LIR/LâŠ™)=11.3 and 11.0 for the Î£L24-
 high bin and theÎ£L24-low bin respectively. As shown in Fig-
 ure11, the two subpopulationsare distributedalongthe dus t-
 temperature sequence of local star-forming galaxies. Gala x-
 iesin theÎ£L24-highbinonaverageshowhotterdust emission
 thanthoseintheÎ£L24-lowbin,suggestingthattheIRluminos-
 ity surface density plays an essential role in shaping IR SED
 (Chanialet al.2006).
 Finally, with UV luminosities derived from GALEX data
 and IR luminosities derived from three band MIPS data, we
 determined a quite precise relationship between the dust ob -
 scuration and SFR for zâˆ¼0.7. Our results show an excel-
 lent agreement between the SFR-dust obscuration relation a t
 zâˆ¼0.7 with that at the present day, indicating that no signif-
 icant evolution occurs since that redshift. Our measuremen ts
 give the mean values of SFR and dust obscuration. The ac-
 tual scatter in dust obscurationcan spreadby 1 - 2dexfor in-
 dividual galaxies of given SFR(Martinet al. 2005b; Xuet al.
 2006; Buat et al. 2006). Reddyet al. (2006) claimed that the
 dust obscuration for star-forming galaxies is systematica lly
 smaller at zâˆ¼2 than the present day. Their sample is dom-
 inated by rest-frame UV-selected galaxies. This may lead to
 a potential selection biasagainst objectswith highIR /UV ra-
 tio (see Buat etal. 2006 for the comparisonbetween UV and
 FIR selected samples of local galaxies and a similar discus-
 sion). Therefore studies based on unbiased samples of high-
 redshift galaxies will help to answer the question whether
 the SFR-dust obscuration relation still holds at z>1. This
