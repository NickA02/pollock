 ABSTRACT
 The evolution of the phase-space density proï¬le in dark matt er (DM) halos is investigated by means
 of constrained simulations, designed to control the mergin g history of a given DM halo. Halos evolve
 through a series of quiescent phases of a slow accretion inte rmitted by violent events of major mergers.
 In the quiescent phases the density of the halo closely follo ws the NFW proï¬le and the phase-space
 density proï¬le, Q(r), is given by the Taylor & Navarro power law, râˆ’Î², where Î²â‰ˆ1.9. Expressing the
 phase-space density by the NFW parameters, Q(r) =Qs(r/Rs)âˆ’Î², the evolution of Qis determined
 byQs. We have found that the eï¬€ective mass surface density within Rs, Î£sâ‰¡ÏsRs, remains constant
 throughout the evolution of a given DM halo along the main bra nch of its merging tree. This invariance
 entails that QsâˆRâˆ’5/2

 . It follows that the phase-space density
 remains constant, in the sense of Qs=const. , in the quiescent phases and it decreases as Râˆ’5/2

 the violent ones. The physical origin of the NFW density proï¬ le and the phase-space density power
 law is still unknown. Yet, the numerical experiments show th at halos recover these relations after
 the violent phases. The major mergers drive Rsto increase and Qsto decrease discontinuously while
 keeping QsÃ—R5/2

 evolves along a sequence of NFW proï¬les with constant energy per unit volume (i.e., pressure) within

 1.INTRODUCTION
 The dynamics of dark matter (DM) halos in the Cold
 Dark Matter (CDM) cosmology can be easily formulated
 as the classical Newtonian N-body problem. Yet, the un-
 derstanding of the equilibrium conï¬guration of the DM
 halos deï¬es a simple analytical approach. The lack of
 analytical understanding is often compensated for by
 numerical simulations which provide empirical knowl-
 edge. The cumulative work in cosmology over the last
 decade or so has led to a broad consensus about two ba-
 sic facts that describe the equilibrium structure of DM
 halos. One is that the spherically-averaged density pro-
 ï¬leÏ(r) is well approximated by the so-called NFW pro-
 ï¬le (Navarro et al. 1996, 1997) or some close variants
 of it (Moore et al. 1998; Jing & Suto 2000; Klypin et al.
 2001). The other is the power law behavior of the phase-
 space density proï¬le, namely Q(r) =Ï(r)/Ïƒ3(r)âˆrâˆ’Î²,
 with Î²â‰ˆ1.9, where Ïƒ(r) is the velocity dispersion
 (Taylor & Navarro 2001).
 Two seemingly orthogonal approaches to the prob-
 lem of the origin of the equilibrium structure in
 DM halos exist. One assumes a monolithic col-
 lapse of a halo that can be approximated by the
 spherical infall model (Gunn & Gott 1972). The ap-
 plication of the model to the cosmological context,
 where the shell crossing has to be explicitly accounted
 for, has resulted in the so-called secondary infall

 1984; Bertschinger 1985; Hoï¬€man & Shaham 1985;
 Ryden & Gunn 1987; Zaroubi & Hoï¬€man 1993; Nusser
 2001; Lokas & Hoï¬€man 2000). The SIM has been tested
 against the N-body simulations and has proven to faith-
 fully reproduce the density proï¬le of simulated DM halos
 (Quinn et al. 1986; Efstathiou et al. 1988; Crone et al.
 1994; Ascasibar et al. 2004; 2007). A closely related vari-
 ant of the SIM replaces its dependence on the primor-
 dial over-density of the proto-halo by the mass accre-
 tion history (MAH) of the halo (Nusser & Sheth 1999;
 Lu et al. 2006; Salvador-SolÂ´ e et al. 2007). The SIM and
 its MAH variant can reproduce also the power law be-
 havior of the phase-space density (Austin et al. 2005;
 GonzÂ´ alez-Casado et al. 2007).
 However, a close inspection of the N-body simu-
 lations reveals that a DM halo evolves very diï¬€er-
 ently from a monolithic quasi-spherical collapse. In
 fact halos are numerically observed to go through a
 sequence of mergers, some labeled as major merg-
 ers in which the two main progenitors are of a sim-
 ilar mass, leading to emergence of the NFW den-
 sity proï¬le (Syer & White 1998; Dekel et al. 2003;
 Subramanian et al. 2000). Romano-Diaz et al. (2006;
 2007, hereafter Paper I and II) studied the formation
 and equilibrium conï¬guration of halos by means of con-
 trolled N-body simulations, with the initial conditions
 set by constrained realizations of Gaussian ï¬elds. These
 simulations were designed to address issues of how the
 merging history aï¬€ects the DM halos. The emerging pic-
 ture is that of a halo evolving viaa sequence of quiescent
 phases of a slow mass accretion intermitted by violent
 episodes of major mergers. In the quiescent phases, the2 Hoï¬€man et al.
 density is well ï¬tted by an NFW proï¬le, the inner (NFW)
 scale radius Rsand the mass enclosed within it ( Ms) re-
 main constant, and the virial radius ( Rvir) grows linearly
 with the expansion parameter ( a). In the violent phases,
 the halos are not in a dynamical equilibrium, but are
 rather in a transition state, resulting in a discontinuous
 growth of RsandRvir. In such a picture a halo is deï¬ned
 in the context of a merger tree â€” at any given time it is
 taken as the most massive progenitor along the branch
 leading to the ï¬nal halo.
 A direct comparison between the SIM and nu-
 merical simulations has been conducted recently by
 Ascasibar et al. (2007). This comparison is based on
 selecting the DM halos from a cosmological simulation,
 tracing them back in time, and recovering their individ-
 ual initial conditions. The SIM has been applied to the
 â€˜primordialâ€™ density proï¬les, and their virial density pro -
 ï¬les have been calculated for diï¬€erent redshifts. The SIM
 calculated proï¬les provided a good match to the evolu-
 tion and structure of the simulated clusters. This is en-
 couraging. However, a rigorous fundamental theory that
 can accommodate both the spherical monolithic collapse
 and the major merger-driven evolution exhibited by the
 simulations is still missing. This motivates us to look
 further into the phenomenology of the phase-space den-
 sity, to gain a further insight into this seemingly simple,
 yet complicated, problem.
 The study of the DM halo evolution has been heav-
 ily focused on the density proï¬le, while the evolution
 of the phase-space density has been largely ignored.
 Peirani & de Freitas Pacheco (2007) presented one of the
 few studies of Q(r) evolution. They found that Q, de-
 ï¬ned as a global quantity characterizing the halo as a
 whole, is generally decreasing with time. Speciï¬cally, it
 exhibits an early rapid decrease (at redshifts z/greaterorsimilar6.5) and
 a late slow decrease. Here we aim at studying the evo-
 lution of the phase-space density within the framework
 of the NFW scaling and the dynamical picture formu-
 lated in Papers I and II. In particular, we shall rely on
 the empirical fact that the dynamics of the DM halos is
 constrained by a new invariant of motion. This invari-
 ant tags a halo along the main branch of the merging
 tree. The NFW scaling and this invariant of motion pro-
 vide a full description of the cosmological evolution of
 the phase-space density for individual halos.
 The structure of the paper is as follows. The analysis
 of the DM halos in Papers I and II is brieï¬‚y reviewed in
 Â§2. General considerations of the evolution of DM halos
 are given in Â§3. The evolution of the phase-space density
 proï¬le is described in Â§4 and self-similarity and scaling
 relations are given in Â§5. A general discussion follows in
 Â§6.
 2.NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS
 In Papers I and II, we investigated the cosmological
 evolution and structure of ï¬ve DM halos by setting the
 initial conditions of the simulations using constrained re -
 alizations of Gaussian ï¬elds. Our basic motivation was
 to perform controlled numerical experiments designed to
 study the dependence of the evolution and structure of a
 given halo on its merging history. The Hoï¬€man & Ribak
 (1991) algorithm of constrained realizations of Gaussian
 ï¬elds has been used to set up the initial conditions. Pa-
 pers I and II present the analysis of ï¬ve diï¬€erent mod-els of a given DM halo, evolving along various merging
 histories. The models were simulated within the frame-
 work of the open CDM (OCDM) model with â„¦ 0= 0.3,
 h= 0.7 and Ïƒ8= 0.9, where â„¦ 0is the current cosmologi-
 cal matter density parameter and Ïƒ8is the variance of the
 density ï¬eld convolved with a top-hat window of radius
 8hâˆ’1Mpc used to normalize the power spectrum. This
 model is very close to the â€˜concordanceâ€™ Î›CDM model
 in its dynamical properties. The models are labeled as
 OCDMa, OCDMb, etc., following the notations of Pa-
 pers I and II. Here we add a new model, run within
 the ï¬‚at-Î› cosmology with the parameters of the WMAP
 three years data base (Spergel et al. 2006). The con-
 straints used to set the model are similar to OCDMa
 and the model is labeled as WMAP3a, yet it is performed
 within a 2563computational box and it starts from a dif-
 ferent random realization of the initial conditions. A full
 description of the numerical simulations, the application
 of the algorithm of constrained realizations and the nu-
 merical code are given in Papers I and II. The WMAP3a
 model is one in a series of runs in the WMAP3 cosmology,
 to be reported in a forthcoming paper. The NFW ï¬tting
 algorithm is described in Paper II and the phase-space
 density power law proï¬le is ï¬tted in a similar way.
 3.GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
 The density proï¬le of DM halos is well approximated
 by the NFW proï¬le,
 Ï(r) =4Ïs
 (r/Rs)(1 +r/Rs)2, (1)
 in which the characteristic density ( Ïs) and scale radius
 (Rs) deï¬ne the NFW proï¬le. Deï¬ning the halo as a col-
 lection of particles in a spherical (say) volume in which
 the mean density equals some critical over-density (which
 is in general redshift dependent) times the mean cosmo-
 logical density, the virial mass ( Mvir) and radius ( Rvir)
 of the halo are determined. It follows that RvirandRs
 (or equivalently MvirandMs) are the two independent
 parameters that deï¬ne an NFW halo.
 Assuming the NFW parameterization, we can write the
 phase-space density proï¬le as
 Q(r) =QsQ(r
 Rs), (2)
 where
 Q(x) =Ï(x)/Ïs/parenleftbig
 Ïƒ(x)/Ïƒs/parenrightbig3, (3)
 Qs=Ïs
 Ïƒ3s, (4)
 Ïƒsis the mean velocity dispersion within Rsandx=
 r/Rs. To the extent that the DM halos are ï¬tted by the
 NFW proï¬le, their Q(x) proï¬le should obey a universal
 relation. Their cosmological evolution is then determined
 by the evolution of Qs.
 4.EVOLUTION OF PHASE-SPACE DENSITY PROFILES
 Evolution of the dimensionless phase-space density
 proï¬le, Q(x), is presented in Fig. 1, where the Q(r/Rs)
 proï¬les of all models are evaluated at diï¬€erent epochs,
 covering the time interval from z= 5.3 (z= 3.35 for
 the WMA3a model) to the present epoch. Fig. 1 clearlyEvolution of phase-space density in dark matter halos 3

 shows that the phase-space density of DM halos follows
 a power law with Î²= 1.94Â±0.01 in the quiescent phases
 The lack of the cosmological evolution of Î²is shown in
 Fig. 2, where Î²is plotted against the cosmological ex-
 pansion parameter afor all the models. This ï¬gure also
 displays the cosmological evolution of the Q(r/Rs) pro-
 ï¬le which is given by Qs. The Qs(a) curves are noisy, but
 a clear and a striking trend can be observed â€” subject
 to aâ‰ˆ20% jitter, Qsremains constant in the quiescent
 phases, and drops discontinuously in the transitions from
 one quiescent phase to the next one, which are induced
 by the violent events. In the violent phases, the NFW
 ï¬tting breaks down and the widely oscillating values of
 Qsare clearly not physical.
 A close inspection of the halo evolution reveals that
 the product Î£ sâ‰¡ÏsRsremains approximately invariant
 as the halo evolves along the main branch of its merg-
 ing tree (Fig. 3). The value of Î£ sï¬‚uctuates around its
 mean of two diï¬€erent modes. In the quiescent phases
 Î£sundergoes fast and correlated ï¬‚uctuations of a small
 amplitude (see next section and Paper II). In the vio-
 lent episodes it exhibits large deviations from the mean
 value. This behavior is associated with timings of major
 mergers when halos are far from the equilibrium. The
 NFW ï¬tting fails here and the resulting NFW param-
 eters are ill-deï¬ned. Ignoring the spikes of the violent
 phases, and averaging over the jittery ï¬‚uctuations in the
 quiescent phases, Î£ sretains its value along the halo evo-
 lution. While the invariance of Î£sin a given quiescent
 phase is not surprising, its ability to retain the value in
 the major merger events is not obviously expected.
 5.SELF-SIMILARITY AND SCALING RELATIONS
 Assuming the empirical ï¬nding of Î£ sinvariance, we
 shall study its ramiï¬cations for the evolution of the
 phase-space density. In the quiescent phases, in which
 the density follows the NFW proï¬le, a halo is expected
 to be in virial equilibrium, as corrobrated by Fig. 13 ofPaper II. In particular the virial ratio, evaluated within
 Rs, should have a constant value, namely,
 Ïƒ2
 s
 Ms/Rsâ‰ˆconst. (5)
 The virial ratio diï¬€ers from unity because the inner part
 of the halo does not constitute an isolated system, and
 its value depends on the shape of the density proï¬le.
 Assuming the constancy of the virial ratio within Rs
 and the invariance of Î£ s,

 The evolution of the phase-space density proï¬le in a given
 halo is described by
 Q(r)âˆÎ£âˆ’1/2

 Rs/parenrightBigâˆ’Î²
 . (7)
 Consequently, for a given halo the following invariance
 holds:
 QsR5/2
 sâ‰ˆconst. (8)
 This prediction has been tested against the ï¬ve models
 of Papers I and II and the Î›CDM halo. Fig. 2 shows
 the cosmological evolution of QsandQsR5/2
 sof these
 models. As with all other quantities that characterize
 the DM halos, the product QsR5/2
 sshows a jittery be-
 havior in the quiescent phases and strong ï¬‚uctuations in
 the violent phases, in which the NFW parameters are ill
 deï¬ned. Apart from this, it remains constant through-
 out the evolution. Only Model B shows a very slight
 increase in the long quiescent phase that follows its last
 major merger.
 TheÏsRsinvariance is to be distinguished from the
 ÏsâˆRâˆ’m

 (Paper II) and from MsâˆRÎ±

 approximation the product is invariant. The lower panel pre sents the evolution of the slope of the Q(r) proï¬le. The slopes of all the models
 converge to Î²â‰ˆ âˆ’1.95.
 This stands in good agreement with Zhao et al.â€™s Î±â‰ˆ
 1.44 in the â€œslow accretion phaseâ€ and Î±â‰ˆ1.92 in the
 â€œrapid accretion phase.â€ The mâ‰ˆ1.39 scaling is ob-
 tained by analyzing each quiescent phase, and it reï¬‚ects
 the ï¬‚uctuations of ÏsandRsaround their mean values
 within that phase. This correlation appear to be driven
 by density ï¬‚uctuations that originate in the region be-
 tween the cusp and Rs, where the density slope varies
 between -1 and -2. The mean values of ÏsandRschange
 from one quiescent phase to another. The mâ‰ˆ1.59
 reï¬‚ects the variation across the diï¬€erent phases. The as-
 sociation of the mâ‰ˆ1.59 and Î±â‰ˆ1.92 with the early
 times of the evolution of halos stems from the fact that
 the violent phases are more abundant at early times. The
 combined analysis of Paper II and the present work yields
 the following picture. In the quiescent phases the values
 ofÏsandRsï¬‚uctuate around constant values, yet their
 product remains invariant along the evolution of a halo.
 The Î£ sinvariance implies that MsâˆR2
 s. This is very
 close to the MsâˆR1.92
 sof Zhao et al. (2003) and the mi-nor discrepancy results from Zhao et al. not separating
 explicitly between the quiescent and violent phases. We,
 therefore, support and validate one of Zhao et al.â€™s main
 points, namely the MsâˆRÎ±
 sscaling, and set Î±= 2.
 Thus, we validate also Zhao et al.â€™s relation between the
 evolution of the concentration parameter and the MAH.
 Moreover, this relation can be easily extended to the
 MAH â€” Qsrelation, given the QsR5/2
 sinvariance.
 A ï¬nal note concerns the entropy of a system of self-
 gravitating collisionless particles. The deï¬nition of the
 entropy (per particle) of a monoatomic ideal gas is givein
 by
 s=kBln(Qâˆ’1) +const, (9)
 where kBis the Boltzmann constant ( e.g.,
 Dalcanton & Hogan 2001; White & Narayan 1987).
 Applying this deï¬nition to the DM particles provides
 one with a formal entropy of the DM. Our ï¬ndings
 concerning structure and evolution of the phase-space
 density can be easily translated to the language of theEvolution of phase-space density in dark matter halos 5

 entropy of the DM. It should be noted here that Eq.
 9 provides a local measure of the entropy. The long
 range nature of the gravitational interactions prohibits
 a simple extension of the entropy to an extensive
 quantity that characterizes the whole halo. Within this
 framework we can only refer to the entropy as a local
 property.
 6.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
 The main elements of the structure and evolution of the
 DM halos can be summarized as follows. Halos evolve
 through two phases, quiescent and violent ones, which
 represent the two extreme cases of smooth accretion and
 major mergers. In the quiescent phase the halo density
 distribution is closely approximated by the NFW pro-
 ï¬le. The inner (within Rs) halo mass surface density,
 Î£s, remains approximately constant throughout its en-
 tire evolution. Most importantly, the major mergers that
 take the halo from one quiescent phase to the other pre-
 serve the value of Î£ s. During the quiescent phases the
 halo phase-space density proï¬le follows a power law of
 the form Q(r) =Qs(r/Rs)âˆ’Î²withÎ²â‰ˆ1.9. The cosmo-
 logical evolution of the phase space density is given by
 Qs. Under the invariance of Î£ sand the assumption of
 the virial equilibrium within Rs, the evolution of Qsis
 dictated by Rs, so that QsâˆRâˆ’5/2
 s. In the quiescent
 phases, Qsremains constant and it decreases discontin-
 uously in the violent phases.
 The Î£ sinvariance and the virial theorem (Eq. 6) imply
 that the evolution of a halo proceeds while conserving its
 surface density and its energy per unit volume, or equiv-
 alently the pressure, within Rs. The interesting pointis that a typical halo undergoes a few violent events of
 major merging that destroy its equilibrium. Following
 each event it regains the NFW structure with a larger
 Rs, while preserving its pressure and the mean surface
 density within the new Rs. Summarizing, a DM halo
 evolves along a sequence of NFW proï¬les, with an ever
 increasing RvirandRsthat grows only discontinuously,
 in the manner described in Paper I, while conserving the
 mean surface density and the pressure within Rs.
 The evolution of the Q(r) proï¬le of a given DM halo
 is predicted by Eq. 7. The controlled numerical experi-
 ments of Papers I and II suggest that, for a given halo,
 Î£sremains constant over a few quiescent phases inter-
 mitted by violent events. All the halos analyzed here
 (apart from WMAP3a) emerge from the same realiza-
 tion of the initial conditions that has been subjected to
 diï¬€erent constraints. In many ways these halos can be
 considered as a single halo that has been manipulated so
 as to modify its merging history. As such they all have
 roughly the same value of Î£ s. The WMAP3a model pro-
 vides an independent realization of a DM halo in a diï¬€er-
 ent cosmology. The value of Î£ sis roughly twice as large
 than in all the other model. Of course the extremely
 poor statistics of our models cannot teach us about the
 scatter in Î£ s. The question arises as to what happens in
 the general case of a large ensemble of DM halos drawn
 from a large cosmological simulation. The scatter in Î£ s
 is expected to determine the evolutionary tracks of the
 phase-spase density proï¬les. It is interesting to study
 the possible environment âˆ’Î£scorrelation, and to what
 extent this aï¬€ects the evolution of the DM halos.6 Hoï¬€man et al.
 TheÏsRsinvariance implies that the Zhao et al. (2003)
 MsâˆRÎ±
 sscaling holds with Î±= 2, and so does the MAH
 - concentration parameter relation. It follows that this
 can be easily extended to calculate a similar MAH âˆ’Qs
 relation. The interesting ramiï¬cation of this result is
 that any statistical algorithm for generating DM halos
 merging trees and/or MAHs can be extended so as to
 provide the evolution of the full NFW parameters of a
 halo along its merging tree. This can be used in semi-
 analytical modeling of galaxy formation in which realiza-
 tions of merging trees include the full NFW structure of
 the halos.
 The deï¬nition of Q(r) as a phase-space density is only
 a poor manâ€™s substitute for the â€™realâ€™ phase-space den-
 sity in the six-dimensional phase space. Yet, pushing the
 analogy further on, a formal entropy is deï¬ned by Eq. 9
 as a local variable. This local deï¬nition cannot be ex-
 tended to provide a global entropy of the halo. It follows
 that statements regarding the evolution of the entropy of
 DM halos are ill-deï¬ned, at least in the current context.
 Nevertheless, in the NFW scaling framework, in which
 the entropy of DM halos is taken as Qs, it increases with
 Rs. In this context, the quiescent phases with Rsâˆ¼const.
 correspond to adiabatic processes which preserve the en-
 tropy, and the violent phases â€” to non-adiabatic ones in
 which the entropy grows.
 The method of introducing an entropy by means of Eq.
 9 can be considered as only formal, and its relation to a
 standard thermodynamics needs to be questioned. Yet,
 Faltenbacher et al. (2007) have recently shown that the
 formally deï¬ned entropy of the DM is very closely as-
 sociated with the classical (ideal gas) entropy of the in-
 tergalactic gas in clusters of galaxies. Faltenbacher et al .
 studied the entropy of the gas and DM in high reso-
 lution adiabatic SPH cosmological simulations â€” â€˜adia-baticâ€™ here is used in the sense that the entropy of the
 gas can only grow due to shock waves. Consequently,
 following the accepted notation, the entropy of the gas
 can be expressed by means of Kgasâ‰¡kBT/Ï2/3, and
 by analogy KDM=Ïƒ2
 DM/Ï2/3
 DMâˆQâˆ’2/3. The power law
 behavior of Q(r) implies that KDMâˆr1.1. Interestingly,
 outside the entropy core of râ‰ˆRs/2 the gas entropy fol-
 lows the DM, namely KgasâˆKDM, and the calculated
 slope agrees well with observations. Faltenbacher et al.
 amended the deï¬nition of Kgas, such that the thermal en-
 ergy is extended to include the kinetic energy of the small
 scale (turbulent motion) and the DM and gas densities
 are normalized by their mean cosmological values. The
 newly deï¬ned Kgasthen coincides with the DM entropy
 outside the entropy core to a very good approximation.
 The analysis of Faltenbacher et al. shows that, at least
 in galaxy clusters, the DM entropy coincides with the
 classical, ideal gas, entropy of the intracluster medium.
 It is not clear a priori why the gas and DM entropies
 should coincide, but numerical simulations suggest that
 they do. The simulations suggest that observational de-
 termination of the entropy of the intracluster gas should
 shed light and constrain the behavior of the DM entropy.
