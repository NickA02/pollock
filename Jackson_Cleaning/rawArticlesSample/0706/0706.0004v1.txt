 ABSTRACT
 We have used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Dat a Release 5 to explore the overall structure
 and substructure of the stellar halo of the Milky Way using âˆ¼4 million color-selected main sequence turn-off
 stars with 0 .2<gâˆ’r<0.4 and 18 .5â‰¤r<22.5. We ï¬t oblate andtriaxial brokenpower-lawmodelsto the da ta,
 and found a â€˜best-ï¬tâ€™ oblateness of the stellar halo c/aâˆ¼0.6, and halo stellar masses between Galactocentric
 radii of 1 and 40kpc of âˆ¼4Ã—108MâŠ™. The density proï¬le of the stellar halo is approximately Ïâˆrâˆ’3; it is
 possible that the power law slope is shallower inside 20kpc a nd steeper outside that radius. Yet, we found that
 all smooth and symmetric models were very poor ï¬ts to the dist ribution of stellar halo stars because the data
 exhibit a great deal of spatial substructure. We quantiï¬ed d eviations from a smooth oblate/triaxial model using
 theRMSofthedataaroundthemodelproï¬leonscales /greaterorsimilar100pc,afteraccountingforthe(known)contributionof
 Poissonuncertainties. WithintheDR5areaoftheSDSS,thef ractionalRMSdeviation Ïƒ/totaloftheactualstellar
 distribution from any smooth, parameterized halo model is /greaterorsimilar40%: hence, the stellar halo is highly structured.
 We compared the observations with simulations of galactic s tellar halos formed entirely from the accretion of
 satellites in a cosmological context by analysing the simul ations in the same way as the SDSS data. While the
 masses, overall proï¬les, and degree of substructure in the s imulated stellar halos show considerable scatter, the
 propertiesanddegreeofsubstructurein theMilkyWayâ€™s hal omatchwell thepropertiesofa â€˜typicalâ€™stellar halo
 built exclusively out of the debris from disrupted satellit e galaxies. Our results therefore point towards a picture
 in whichan importantfractionofthestellar halooftheMilk yWay hasbeenaccretedfromsatellite galaxies.

 1.INTRODUCTION
 ThestellarhalooftheMilkyWayhasanumberofdistinctive
 characteristics which make it a key probe of galaxy formatio n
 processes. Milky Way halo stars have low metallicity, alpha
 element enhancement, a high degree of support from random
 motions, and a roughly râˆ’3power law distribution in an oblate
 halo (Eggen, Lynden-Bell & Sandage 1962; Chiba & Beers
 2000; Yanny et al. 2000; Larsen & Humphreys 2003; Lemon
 etal.2004;Newberg&Yanny2005;Juri Â´cetal.2007). Thelow
 metallicities and alpha element enhancements suggest that the
 starsformedrelativelyearlyinthehistoryoftheUniverse. Yet,
 there has been disagreement about where these stars formed:
 did they form in situin the early phases of the collapse of the
 MilkyWay (e.g.,Eggen,Lynden-Bell& Sandage1962),ordid
 the stars form outside the Milky Way in satellite galaxies on ly
 to be accreted by the Milky Way at a later date (e.g., Searle
 & Zinn 1978; Bullock, Kratsov, & Weinberg 2001; Bullock &
 Johnston2005;Abadi,Navarro,& Steinmetz2006)?
 A keydiscriminantbetweenthese picturesisthestructureo fthe stellar halo. In situformationwould predict relativelylittle

 chicalcontextpredictthat the vast majorityof stellar hal ostars
 should be accreted from disrupted satellite galaxies (John ston
 1998; Bullock, Kratsov, & Weinberg 2001; Bullock & John-
 ston 2005; Abadi, Navarro, & Steinmetz 2006). The accumu-
 lated debris from ancient accretion episodes rapidly dispe rses

 in the last few Gyr can remain in relatively distinct structu res.
 Simulations predict quite a wide range in â€˜lumpinessâ€™ of ste l-
 lar halos, with a general expectationof a signiï¬cant amount of
 recognisable halo substructure (Bullock, Kratsov, & Weinb erg
 2001;Bullock& Johnston2005).
 Consequently, a number of groups have searched for sub-
 structure in the Milky Wayâ€™s stellar halo, identifying at le ast
 3 large-scale features â€” tidal tails from the disruption of t he

 Yet, it remains unclear whether accretion is the dominant
 mechanism for halo build-up. A key observable is the fractio n
 ofstars insubstructure(oraquantitativemeasureof thede gree
 of substructure): if much of the halo mass is held in substruc -
 tures, this argues for an accretion origin; if instead a tiny frac-
 tionofhalostarsisheldinsubstructures,thisplaces(ver y)tight

 means,andtoï¬ttherestwithasmoothhalocomponent;there-
 mainder would be in â€˜overdensitiesâ€™ (e.g., Newberg & Yanny
 2005). Here, we take a different approach. Since one does
 not know a prioriwhich stars should be â€˜smooth haloâ€™ stars
 andwhichareinâ€˜overdensitiesâ€™,wetreat allhalostarsequ ally,
 ï¬t a smooth model, and examine the RMS of the data around
 thatsmoothmodel(accountingforthecontributiontotheRM S
 from counting statistics). In this way, we obtain a quantita tive
 measureofthedegreeofhalostructureon /greaterorsimilar100pcscaleswith-
 out having to make uncomfortabledecisions about which star s
 should be ï¬t with a smooth component and which should be

 In this paper, we apply this technique to explore the struc-
 ture of the stellar halo of the Milky Way, and place constrain ts
 on the fraction of stars in stellar halo under- or over-densi ties
 using imaging data from the Fifth Data Release (DR5) of the
 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000; Adelman-

 2.1.Colorâ€“magnitudediagrams: anintroduction
 To help get oneâ€™s bearings, it is instructive to examine some
 colorâ€“magnitudediagrams(CMD)derivedfromthesedata(Fi g.

 10âˆ’3stars/deg2to 7.1 stars/deg2; such a scaled CMD is fre-
 quentlycalled a Hess diagram. To help interpret this Hess di a-
 gram, we show two additional Hess diagrams for two globular
 clusters covered by these data: Pal 5 and NGC 5024 (in what
 follows,distancesandmetallicitiesfortheseandallothe rglob-
 ular clusters are adopted from Harris 1996). The top middle
 panel of Fig. 1 shows a Hess diagram for stars in the globular
 clusterPal5(acircleofradius0 .â—¦5aroundtheposition l=0.â—¦85

 Onecanclearlysee themainsequenceturnoffwith gâˆ’râˆ¼0.2
 andrâˆ¼21, with the lower main sequence extending redwards
 towards fainter magnitudes and the subgiant branch extendi ng
 redwards towards brighter magnitudes. In the top right pane l
 we show a similar Hess diagram for NGC 5024; because this

 ulated and shows a more prominent red giant branch (extend-
 ingtowardsbrightermagnitudeswith gâˆ’râˆ¼0.5)andhorizonal
 branch(with gâˆ’r/lessorsimilar0 andrâˆ¼17).
 There are a few points to note about Fig. 1. Firstly, for
 old populations such as those in globular clusters it is clea r
 that the color of the main sequence turn-off (MSTO) is a
 metallicity indicator (this point is discussed in more deta il for
 SDSS isochrones in Girardi et al. 2004). Comparing Pal 5
 ([Fe/H]âˆ¼âˆ’1.4,(gâˆ’r)MSTOâˆ¼0.3)withNGC5024([Fe /H]âˆ¼âˆ’2.1,
 (gâˆ’r)MSTOâˆ¼0.15),onecanseethatoldverymetal-poorpopu-
 lations([Fe /H]/lessorsimilarâˆ’2)havebluermainsequenceturn-offscom-
 pared to less metal-poor populations ([Fe /H]âˆ¼âˆ’1.5). Sec-
 ond, MSTO stars are a reasonably good distance indicator, al -
 beit with signiï¬cant scatter. In Fig. 2, we show the absolute
 magnitude distribution of all stars with 0 .2<gâˆ’r<0.4 in
 Pal 5 (solid line: distance=22 .6kpc), NGC 5024 (dashed line:
 distance=18 .4kpc)andathirdglobularclusterNGC5053(dot-
 tedline: [Fe /H]âˆ¼âˆ’2.3,distance=16 .2kpc). Themean r-band
 absolute magnitudes of the distributions are (4.3,4.7,5.0 ) re-
 spectively, and all distributions individually have RMS âˆ¼0.9

 uncertainty, the MSTO is a good distance indicator with âˆ¼0.9
 magscatter.
 ExaminingthetopleftpanelofFig.1,inthelightoftheglob -
 ular cluster CMDs, it is possible to interpret some of the fea -
 turesofthe b>30â—¦Hessdiagram. At all distances,the MSTO
 is visible as a clearly-deï¬nedas a sharp â€˜blue edgeâ€™ to the di s-
 tribution, indicating to ï¬rst order that the stars in the gal actic
 disk at largescale heightsand in the stellar haloare domina ted
 by a metal-poorold populationwith ages not that dissimilar to
 those of globular clusters; this is the assumption that we wi ll
 adopt in the remainder of this paper. At gâˆ’r<0.5, one sees
 the MSTO for stars in the stellar disk at /greaterorsimilarkpcscale heights(at
 r<18; often the disk at such scale heightsis referredto as the
 thick disk) and in the stellar halo (at r>18). One can see a
 â€˜kinkâ€™ in the MSTO at râˆ¼18, as highlighted by the contours;
 we interpret this as signifying a metallicity differencebe tween
 the disk at âˆ¼kpc scale heights and stellar halo (this transition
 is also very prominent in Fig. 4 of Lemon et al. 2004 and in
 Chen et al. 2001, who interpret this CMD feature in the sameway). The MSTO in the stellar halo has gâˆ’râˆ¼0.3, similar
 to that of Pal 5 ([Fe /H]âˆ¼âˆ’1.4) and âˆ¼0.15mag redder than
 those of NGC 5024 and NGC 5053 with ([Fe /H]/lessorsimilarâˆ’2). This
 suggests a halo metallicity [Fe /H]âˆ¼âˆ’1.5, in excellent agree-
 ment with measured halo metallicity distributions, which p eak
 at[Fe/H]âˆ¼âˆ’1.6(e.g.,Lairdetal. 1998;Vennet al.2004).
 2.2.Hessdiagramsofstructure inthestellarhalo
 One of the main goals of this paper is to explore the degree
 ofsubstructureinthestellarhalooftheMilkyWay. Onewayo f
 visualizingthisissueisthroughtheinspectionofHessdia grams
 where pairs of lines of sight are subtracted, following Eqn. 12.
 We have done this exercise for three such lines of sight in Fig .
 1, where we have chosen three line-of-sight pairs where the
 subtraction shouldhave been close to zero, if the stellar halo
 oftheMilkyWay weresymmetricandsmooth.
 2An extension of this methodology was used by Xu et al. (2006), who use
 the SDSSDR4 to study stellar halo structure using star count s and color distri-
 butions of stars atGalactic latitudes bâ‰¥55â—¦.4 Bell et al.
 FIG. 2.â€”Ahistogram oftheabsolute magnitudes ofstarswith0 .2<gâˆ’r<
 0.4 in three globular clusters: Pal 5, NGC 5053, and NGC 5024. Th ese dis-
 tributions give an impression of the actual convolution ker nel suffered by the
 0.2<gâˆ’r<0.4 MSTO stars in the halo of the Milky Way when going from
 distance to apparent magnitude. In this work, we choose to ap proximate this
 distribution for modeling the stellar halo with a Gaussian d istribution with
 /angbracketleftMr/angbracketright=4.5mag and ÏƒMr=0.9mag,an appropriate choice for astellar popula-
 tion with [Fe/H] âˆ¼âˆ’1.5.
 The lower left panel of Fig. 1 shows the difference of two
 differentlinesofsight( l,b)=(300 ,70)â€”alineofsighttowards
 the Virgo overdensity and a part of the Sagittarius stream â€”
 and (l,b) = (60 ,70); in a symmetric model such a subtraction
 should come out to zero. The grey levels saturate at deviatio ns
 ofÂ±100%. It is clear that the ( l,b) = (300 ,70) line-of sight
 has strong order-of-unity overdensities at MSTOs fainter t han
 r>21, or distances of >20kpc assuming a MSTO absolute
 magnitudeof Mrâˆ¼4.5. Onecansee alsoa weaksub-giantand
 red giant branch feature at gâˆ’râˆ¼0.5 and 18 <r<20, again
 indicatingdistances >20kpc.
 The lower middle shows a line of sight towards ( l,b) =
 (44,37)minustheHessdiagramforstarstowards( l,b)=(15 ,41).
 This subtraction would be expected to come out close to, but
 not exactly, zero. It would be ideal to be able to subtract off
 the â€˜correctâ€™ pairing of ( l,b) = (316 ,37); however, SDSS has
 not mapped that area of sky owing to its southern declination ,
 Î´=âˆ’25. Thegreyscalesaturatesat Â±50%. Thereareminorar-
 tifacts in the subtraction;however,onecan clearlysee an o ver-
 density of main sequence stars with a MSTO with râˆ¼20.5,
 correspondingtoa distanceof âˆ¼16kpc.
 The lower-right panel shows a line of sight towards ( l,b) =
 (167,35) â€” a line of sight towards part of the Low-Latitude
 overdensity â€” minus that of ( l,b)=(193 ,35). In a symmetric
 halo this subtractionshouldbe identicallyzero. The greys cale
 saturates at Â±50%. There is a weak MSTO overdensityat râˆ¼
 19mag,some âˆ¼7kpcfromtheobserver.
 While these lines of sight have been selected to show (vary-ing degrees) of halo inhomogeneity3, they sufï¬ce to illustrate
 two key points. First, the halo is far from homogeneous,
 with strong order-of-unity overdensities as well as weaker âˆ¼
 10âˆ’20% features. Second, owing to the partial sky coverage
 of the SDSS, it is difï¬cult to visualize and quantitatively e x-
 plore the structure of the Milky Wayâ€™s stellar halo using CMD
 subtractions.
 2.3.Mainsequenceturn-offstarmapsofthe stellarhalo
 One more intuitive approach to the distribution of stars in
 the stellar halo is to construct maps of the number of MSTO
 starsindifferentmagnitude(therefore,roughlydistance )slices.
 We select MSTO stars with foreground extinction-corrected
 0.2<gâˆ’r<0.4; this color range was selected empirically
 to encompass the most densely-populated bins of color space
 for the halo MSTO stars in Fig. 1. In Â§2.1, we showed that in
 such a color bin the average absolute magnitude of the MSTO
 stars in that bin were 4.3 and 4.7 respectively for Palomar 5
 ([Fe/H]âˆ¼âˆ’1.4)andNGC5024([Fe /H]âˆ¼âˆ’2.1);accordingly,
 we adopt an average MSTO Mr=4.5 in what follows for stars
 inthecolorbin0 .2<gâˆ’r<0.4. Suchanabsolutemagnitudeis
 in agreementwith modelCMDs, whichsuggest Mr=4.7Â±0.2
 for stars with metallicities [Fe /H]âˆ¼âˆ’1.5Â±0.5. We make the
 assumption that all stars in the stellar halo are â€˜oldâ€™ (i.e. , ap-
 proximatelythesameageasthecalibratingglobularcluste rs).
 We show 0.5mag wide bins of r-band magnitude between
 18.5â‰¤r<22.5, corresponding to heliocentric distances of
 7/lessorsimilard/kpc/lessorsimilar40. At such heliocentric distances, the vertical
 distance above the Galactic plane is /greaterorsimilar5kpc along all lines of
 sight, or at /greaterorsimilar5 scale heightsfollowingthe âˆ¼900pc thick disk
 scale height estimated by Larsen & Humphreys (2003). Thus,
 thedominantcontributiontotheMSTOmapsisfromthestella r
 halo. TheresultingLambertazimuthalequal-areapolarpro jec-
 tions,logarithmically-scaled,areshowninFig.34.
 While one loses the ability to probe for population differ-
 encesin the stellar halobecauseofthebroadcolorbinadopt ed
 to derive these densities, it is much more straightforward t o
 visualize the distribution of halo MSTO stars using this tec h-
 nique. From Figs. 1 and 2, one can see that MSTO stars at a
 single distancewill showup in multipledistancebins: the b ins
 are0.5magwide,andtheRMS ofasingledistancestellarpop-
 ulation is âˆ¼0.9mag. This can be seen easily from inspection
 of some of the â€˜hot pixelsâ€™ in Fig. 3, corresponding to known
 globularclustersordwarfgalaxies. Thesefeaturespersis tfrom

 3Although, in fact, we found it impossible to avoid at least lo w-level inho-
 mogeneity along any pair of lines of sight.

 Focusing on the brightest bins, 18 .5â‰¤r<20, correspond-

 is probing lines of sight which pass âˆ¼5kpc from the Galactic

 case of the Galactic anticenter,such a structure is not expe cted
 in a oblate/triaxial halo model, and recalling the /lessorsimilar1kpc scale
 height of the thick disk cannot be a thick disk; this is the wel l-
 knownLow-Latitudestream (e.g.,Newberget al. 2002;PeÃ±ar -

 Focusing on the more distant bins, 20 â‰¤r<22.5, corre-
 sponding to heliocentric distances between âˆ¼14kpc and âˆ¼
 35kpc, one ï¬nds little contribution from the Low-Latitude
 stream. Instead, superimposed on a reasonably smooth back-
 ground is a prominent contribution from large tidal tails fr om
 the ongoing interaction of the Milky Way with the Sagittariu s

 While it is clear from these maps that the stellar halo of the
 Milky Way is not completely smooth, there is a â€˜smoothâ€™ (i.e. ,
 not obviously structured) component which dominates these
 maps: if there are variations in this component, these must b e

 be devised to probe halo structures on such scales. In this pa -

 represent the Milky Way, and to ask about the fraction of star s

 3.MODELSOF ASMOOTHLY-DISTRIBUTEDSTELLARHALO
 The stellar halo of the Milky Way is modeled using an tri-
 axial broken power-law, where we explore oblate and prolate
 distributions as special cases of triaxial. The minor axis o f the
 ellipsoid is constrained to be aligned with the normal to the
 Galactic disk (this is is contrast with Newberg & Yanny 2005
 and Xu et al. 2006, who allow the minor axis to vary freely).
 There are 7 free parameters: the normalization A(constrained
 directlythroughrequiringthatthemodelandobservations have
 thesamenumberofstarsinthemagnitudeandcolorrangecon-
 sidered in this paper), the two power laws Î±inandÎ±out, the
 break radius rbreak,b/a,c/a, and the Galactocentric longitude
 of the major axis Lmajor. We adopt a grid search, with between
 4 and 10 values in each parameter of interest, yielding typi-
 callyseveralhundredtoseveralthousandsmoothmodelstot est

 Galacticcenterof8kpcanda Mr=4.5fortheMSTOstarswith
 0.2<gâˆ’r<0.4,witha ÏƒMr=0.9mag.
 We deï¬ne the best ï¬t to be the ï¬t for which the RMS de-

 contribution of Poisson noise to Ïƒhas been removed, leaving
 only the contribution of actual halo structure to the varian ce6.
 Thus, even though we have adopted a pixel size of 0 .5â—¦Ã—0.5â—¦
 in what follows (corresponding to >100pc scales at the dis-
 tances of interest), our results are to ï¬rst order independe nt of
 binningscale (becauseempiricallywe ï¬nd that the vast majo r-
 ity of the variance is contained on âˆ¼kpc scales and greater).
 We defer to a future paper the exercise of understanding and
 interpreting the scale dependence of stellar halo substruc ture.
 The main uncertaintyin the estimated valuesof Ïƒ/total is from
 the major contributions of a few large structures on the sky t o
 Ïƒ/total,boththroughinï¬‚uencingtheâ€˜bestï¬tâ€™andthroughth eir
 direct contribution to the residuals. Later, we attempt to q uan-
 tifythisuncertaintythroughexclusionofthemostobvious sub-
 structures from consideration before ï¬tting and estimatio n of
 Ïƒ/total.
 The model parameters(includingthe normalization)give an
 estimate of the total number of stars in the halo. We cal-
 culate the total number of stars contained in the model with
 Galactocentric radius 1 â‰¤rGC/kpcâ‰¤40. In order to inter-
 pret this value as a mass, it is necessary to convert the numbe r
 of 0.2<gâˆ’r<0.4 stars into a mass by calculating a mass-
 to-number ratio. We adopt an empirical approach, following
 Newberg & Yanny (2005). Given that the Pal 5 MSTO color
 seems to be a good match to the stellar halo MSTO color, we
 use the mass of Pal 5 ( âˆ¼5000M âŠ™; Odenkirchen et al. 2002)
 and the number of stars in Pal 5 above background ( âˆ¼1069
 stars with 0 .2<gâˆ’r<0.4) to deï¬ne a mass-to-number ra-
 tioâˆ¼4.7MâŠ™/MSTO star7. This ratio is in excellent agree-
 ment with values derived using stellar population models fo r
 populations with [Fe /H]â‰¤âˆ’1.5; these models have values of
 âˆ¼4MâŠ™/MSTOstar.
 As is clear from Figs. 3 and 8, a signiï¬cant part of the de-
 viations from a smooth stellar halo is driven by the Sagittar -
 ius and Low-Latitude streams, and by the Virgo overdensity.
 We therefore run the whole minimization twice, once allow-
 ing allb>30â—¦data to deï¬ne the ï¬t, and a second time mask-
 ing out most of the Sagittarius and Low-Latitude streams, an d
 the Virgo overdensity, by masking regions with b<35â—¦and
 0<X<30, where Xis the abscissa of the equal-area projec-

 From inspection of Fig. 4, it is clear that a variety of dif-

 The covariance of the different ï¬tting parameters of the

 is clear that the degeneracies in Î±in,Î±outandrbreakindicate
 that there are a number of different ways to construct reason -

 The results for triaxial models are shown in Fig. 7. We do
 notshowtheresultsforthepower-lawparameters Î±in,Î±outand

 parametersis verysimilar tothe oblatehalocase. We focusi n-

 angle between the long axis and the line between the Galactic
 Center[GC]andSun).
 The best triaxial ï¬t is only very marginally better than the
 best oblate ï¬t, with Ïƒ/total= 0 .42; in particular, the best tri-
 axial ï¬t is still a very poor ï¬t to the stellar halo of the Milky
 Way. Inspection of Fig. 7 shows that the best models are only
 mildly triaxial with b/a/greaterorsimilar0.8, and with Lmajorâˆ¼âˆ’10 (roughly
 lining up with the Sagittarius stream). In the bottom panels
 we show the covariance of the parameters of all models with
 Ïƒ/total<0.45. There is little obvious covariance between the
 â€˜triaxialityâ€™ parameters, or between the power law paramet ers
 and the triaxiality parameters. This stresses the difï¬cult y in
 ï¬tting a unique model to the halo; owing to the signiï¬cant de-

 The residuals are smoothed by a 42â€²Gaussian kernel to sup-

 In these simulations the entire halo arises, by model constr uction, from the
 disruption of satellite galaxies.
 Bullock & Johnston (2005) studied the structure of stellar h a-
 los created exclusively through the merging and disruption of
 reasonably realistic satellite galaxies.12These studies found
 that the debris from disrupted satellite galaxies produced stel-
 lar halos with: i)roughlypower-law proï¬les with Î±âˆ¼âˆ’3 over
 10â€“30kpc from the galactic center (e.g., Fig. 9 of Bullock &

 tegrated over all radii), and iii)richly substructured halos with
 increasinglyevidentsubstructureat largerdistances(e. g.,Figs.
 13and14ofBullock&Johnston2005).
 5.1.A quantitativecomparisonwith simulatedstellarhalos
 We quantify the last statement through comparison of the
 SDSS data for the stellar halo with 11 simulated stellar halo s

 growing rigid potential for the central disk galaxy in the Bu l-
 lock&Johnston(2005)simulationsleadstoexcessstructur ein
 the central parts. Furthermore, it is possible that the real stel-
 lar halo has a â€˜smoothâ€™ component formed either in situin the
 potential well of the galaxy or accreted so early that no spa-tial structure remains. Our analysisshowsthat there is no n eed
 for such a smooth componentto explain the data, and suggests
 that a smooth component does not dominate the halo at radii
 5<rGC/kpc<45. Yet, we have not tested quantitatively how
 largeasmoothcomponentcouldlieinthisradialrangeandst ill
 lead to the observed RMS: such an exercise will be the object
 ofafuturework.
 5.2.Limitationsofthiscomparison
 While there are steps which can and will be taken with this
 dataset to sharpen the comparison with the simulations (e.g .,
 a quantitative comparison of the morphology and spatial sca le
 of substructure, and the investigation of substructure met allic-
 ities), it is nonetheless clear that â€˜small number statisti csâ€™ is a
 key limitation of this work. The SDSS DR5 contiguouslycov-
 ers only 1/5 of the sky, encompassing some 5â€“10% of all halo
 stars, with Galactocentric radii between 5 and 45kpc (as est i-
 matedbycomparisonofthesmoothhalostellarmasseswithth e
 actual mass contained in the maps). Larger and deeper multi-
 color imaging surveys will be required to expand the coverag e
 of the Milky Wayâ€™s stellar halo, probing to larger halo radii
 where models predict that halo substructure should be easie r
 to discern(see,e.g.,the prominentsubstructuresdiscove redby
 Sesar et al. 2007 using RR Lyrae stars in the multiply-imaged
 â€˜Stripe 82â€™ of the SDSS). Yet, there is signiï¬cant halo-to-h alo

 More powerful constraints will come from studies of the stel -

 6.CONCLUSIONS
 Inthispaper,wehavequantiï¬edthedegreeof(sub-)structu re
 in the Milky Wayâ€™s stellar halo. We have used a sample of
 stellar halo main sequence turn-offstars, isolated using a color
 cutof0 .2<gâˆ’r<0.4,andï¬toblateandtriaxialbrokenpower-
 lawmodelsofthedensitydistributionto thedata.
 We ï¬nd that the â€˜bestâ€™ ï¬t oblateness of the stellar halo is
 c/aâˆ¼0.6Â±0.1overtheGalactocentricradialrange5to40kpc.
 Other halo parameters are signiï¬cantly less well-constrai ned;
 manydifferentcombinationsof parameters(includingmild tri-
 axiality)canprovidecomparablygoodï¬ts. Asinglepowerla w

 outside that range are also acceptable. The halo stellar mas s

 Qualitatively,theseresultsshowthatthestellarâ€˜substr uctureâ€™
 foundin the Milky Wayâ€™s halo is not at all a small perturturba -
 tionontopofasmoothhalo. Remarkably,thissameconclusio n
 holds when excising the most prominent known substructures
 fromtheanalysis,suchasthe Sagittariusstream,andthenc on-
 sideringtheremainingareaofthesky.
 Wecomparedtheseobservationalresultswithmodelsofstel -
 lar halo growth in a cosmological context taken from Bullock
 & Johnston (2005). In these models, the stellar halo arises
 exclusively from the disruption of and mergers with satelli te
 galaxies. The models were analysed in the same way as the
 SDSS data. Their models predict Î±âˆ¼âˆ’3 in the radial range
 10â€“30kpc, halo masses âˆ¼109MâŠ™integrated over all radii (or
 masses âˆ¼3Ã—108MâŠ™in theradialrange1â€“40kpc),andrichly-
 structured stellar halos with Ïƒ/total/greaterorsimilar0.2. At radii where the
 model predictions are most robust, the models show a range
 of degreesofsubstructure,fromsubstantiallyless thanth atob-
 served for the Milky Way to substantially more. Furthermore ,
 the character of the substructure appears very similar to th at
 showed by the Milky Wayâ€™s stellar halo. While it is clear that
 the models are not perfect, this comparison lends considera ble
 quantitative weight to the idea that a dominant fraction of t he
 stellar halo of the Milky Way is composed of the accumulated
 debrisfromthedisruptionofdwarfgalaxies.
