 Abstract
 We analyse the 30 October, 2004, X1.2/SF solar event that occ urred in AR 10691
 (N13 W18) at around 11:44 UT. Observations at 212 and 405 GHz o f the Solar
 Submillimeter Telescope (SST), with high time resolution ( 5 ms), show an intense
 impulsive burst followed by a long-lasting thermal phase. E UV images from the
 Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SOHO/EIT) are used to identify the pos-
 sible emitting sources. Data from the Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN) com-
 plement our spectral observations below 15 GHz. During the i mpulsive phase the
 turnover frequency is above 15.4 GHz. The long-lasting phas e is analysed in terms of
 thermal emission and compared with GOES observations. From the ratio between
 the two GOES soft X-ray bands, we derive the temperature and e mission measure,
 which is used to estimate the free-free submillimeter ï¬‚ux de nsity. Good temporal
 agreement is found between the estimated and observed proï¬l es, however the former
 is larger than the latter.

 Preprint submitted to Elsevier Science 31 October 20131 Introduction
 It is widely accepted that solar ï¬‚ares imply the release of la rge amounts of
 energy, which go mainly in the acceleration of particles: el ectrons and ions.
 The interaction of these particles with the medium, plasma a nd magnetic ï¬eld,
 produces radiation by very diï¬€erent mechanisms, which is ob served at Earth
 in a wide range of wavelengths. Of particular interest are el ectrons moving
 along the magnetic lines and producing gyrosynchrotron emi ssion observed
 at microwaves and shorter wavelengths. Gyrosynchrotron em ission of mildly
 relativistic electrons is distributed in a broad continuum at high harmonics of
 the fundamental frequency Î½B=eB/(2Ï€mec), where eis the electron charge,
 Bthe magnetic ï¬eld strength, methe electron mass at rest and cthe speed of
 light. The maximum emission is centred around Î½â‰ƒÎ½BÎ³2, with Î³the electron
 Lorentz factor (Dulk, 1985). Taking 100 â‰¤Bâ‰¤1000 G, indicative values
 ofÎ³are between 2 and 5 for a 10 GHz photon. Observationally, Kosu gi et al.
 (1988) found that the highest correlation between centimet ric wavelengths and
 hard X-rays (HXR) happens between 17 GHz and 80 keV; that is, e lectrons
 with energies â‰¤200 keV. Therefore, radio observations at shorter waveleng ths
 oï¬€er new insights to understand processes that involve high energy electrons
 during solar ï¬‚ares, where current HXR detector technology d oes not provide
 enough sensitivity and/or signal to noise ratios to observe weak ï¬‚ares. Since
 1999, the only submillimeter instrument dedicated to solar observation is the
 Solar Submillimeter Telescope (SST, see e.g., Kaufmann et a l., 2001) oper-
 ating at 212 and 405 GHz. From the theoretical arguments give n above, >4
 MeV electrons should produce the synchrotron emission obse rved with SST.
 In this work, we report the multiwavelength observations of the impulsive and
 gradual phases of an X-class ï¬‚are that occurred on 30 October , 2004. In the
 following section we describe the instruments and data anal ysis. In Section 3,
 we analyse the impulsive phase of the ï¬‚are; while in Section 4 , we do the same
 for the gradual phase. Finally, we give our concluding remar ks.
 2 Observations and principal characteristics of the event
 The SST (Kaufmann et al., 2001) is a radome enclosed 1.5 m sing le dish an-
 tenna with room temperature receivers in a focal array: 4 at 2 12 GHz and 2 at
 405 GHz, with 5 ms time resolution. On 30 October, 2004, SST wa s tracking
 AR 10691 (N13 W18) with its beam 5. In Figure 1, we sketch the po sition of
 SST beams with crosses on a 195 ËšA EUV image of EIT (Delaboudiniere et al.,
 1995); the size of the crosses is equal to the HPBW. While beam s 2, 3 and 4
 (212 GHz) are round, beam 5 (405 GHz) has an elliptical shape, with minor

 and major axes in the directions shown in the ï¬gure. Because o f the high at-
 mospheric attenuation only two beams observed this event, o ne at 212 GHz
 (beam 3) and one at 405 GHz (beam 5). Beams 1 (212 GHz) and 6 (405 GHz)
 are not shown in the ï¬gure. Since only two beams observed the e vent, we can-
 not use the multibeam technique (Costa et al., 1995) to locat e the centroid of
 emission.
 Assuming that the radio source is coincident with the EUV bri ght loop (see
 Fig. 1), we correct the observed antenna temperature at 212 a nd 405 GHz
 for the misalignment. During calibration the antenna tempe ratures are also
 corrected for atmospheric attenuation. Finally, the corre cted antenna tem-
 peratures are converted to ï¬‚ux densities, F, using the well known formula:
 F= 2kbTa/Ae, where kbis the Boltzmann constant, Tathe corrected antenna
 temperature and Aethe eï¬€ective area of the antenna. We estimate a 40% un-
 certainty for the whole process.
 Data at microwave frequencies with 1 second time resolution were obtained
 by the Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN, Guidice et al., 1 981). Figure 2
 shows the time proï¬les of the event at diï¬€erent wavelengths. At 15.4 GHz, we
 see that the burst starts at 11:42:40 UT as a small enhancemen t that evolves
 into the impulsive phase with a maximum ï¬‚ux density around 33 00 s.f.u. at
 11:44:09 UT. The increasing phase is characterized by short emissions that can

 with no bursts, reaching the minimum value (close to the pre- ï¬‚are level) at
 11:45:25 UT. Afterward, a post burst increase is observed un til approximately
 11:51 UT. This gradual phase has also some bursting episodes characteristic
 of particle injections.
 Although the 212 GHz time proï¬le is in general smoother than t hat at 15.4
 GHz, most of the features observed at 15.4 GHz are also presen t, with smaller
 amplitude, at 212 GHz. The starting time of the burst at 212 GH z coincides
 with that at 15.4 GHz (11:42:40 UT), but the peak time is delay ed by 3
 seconds (11:44:12 UT at 212 GHz). The gradual phase is also pr esent with
 sudden changes, probably, of instrumental origin. The 405 G Hz time proï¬le

 GHz, is in general delayed in 6 seconds. The decaying phase is more extended
 than in the other frequencies and shows the presence of longe r features, some
 of these features could have an atmospheric origin, and do no t allow us to
 clearly recognize the gradual phase.
 Unfortunately, no HXR data are available for this event. Ins tead, we have
 used the time derivative of GOES 1.5 â€“ 12 keV soft X-ray (SXR) c hannel with
 3 seconds temporal resolution to compare with the radio ï¬‚ux d ensity. The
 sensitivity of GOES is better than 5 10âˆ’8W mâˆ’2, taking this value as the
 ï¬‚ux uncertainty, the ï¬‚ux time derivative has a mean uncertai nty better thanâˆš
 2 5 10âˆ’8/3 W mâˆ’2sâˆ’1âˆ¼3 10âˆ’8W mâˆ’2sâˆ’1. The time derivative of GOES
 channel 3 (bottom curve in Fig. 2) mimics very well the radio t ime proï¬les
 during the rising phase and is coincident in time, but has two clear maxima,
 the ï¬rst peaking in coincidence with the 15.4 GHz emission. W e will show later
 that the second GOES time derivative peak, still during the r ising phase, is
 also present at the other frequencies, but during their deca ying phase. Finally,
 the decaying phase in this curve lasts longer than the others and has some
 bursting episodes.
 We use the wavelet transform (see e.g. Daubechies, 1992) to c ompare the
 time proï¬les. Wavelets are very useful to discriminate the d iï¬€erent time scales
 5in a time series. We have integrated our data to the lowest tim e resolu-
 tion, namely 3 seconds and applied the wavelet transform imp lemented by
 Torrence and Compo (1998) based on a Morlet mother wavelet wi th wavenum-
 ber 6. In Figure 3 each contour represents a structure resolv ed by the transform
 with a characteristic scale in the ordinates occurring at th e time in the ab-
 scissas. We note that for each frequency the minimum contour level plotted
 is much greater than the signal uncertainty. We have overplo tted the density
 ï¬‚ux at 15.4 GHz (dark thick curve), 212 GHz (light thick curve ) and the time
 derivative of the GOES ï¬‚ux (black thin curve). The dashed cur ve represents
 thecone-of-inï¬‚uence of the transformation, i.e., where the boundaries do not
 aï¬€ect the result. We observe that near peak time (11:44 UT) th ere are three
 groups of structures with scales around 10â€“20 seconds. The ï¬ rst one, a little
 before 11:44 UT, is observed at the three frequencies with no appreciable delay
 between them. The second one, just after 11:44 UT is present a lso at the three
 frequencies. The last one ( âˆ¼11:44:30 UT) is observed at 15.4 GHz and GOES
 time derivative. At 212 GHz, this structure appears only aft er 11:44:40 UT.
 Other structures with longer duration are also observed for the 40 seconds
 scale, around 11:45:50 UT and around 11:46:30 UT. In general , the wavelet
 transforms are similar for the diï¬€erent frequencies, inclu ding the coincidence
 in time of the characteristic features at the diï¬€erent scale s. Time proï¬les do
 not reï¬‚ect this in a more evident way because the relative imp ortance of the
 pulses are diï¬€erent.
 3 The impulsive phase
 Figure 4 (left panel) depicts the time evolution of the 2.695 and 15.4 GHz
 emissions at the top, together with the temporal evolution o f the optically
 thick spectral index at the bottom. This index is determined from the ï¬‚ux
 densities at 2.695, 4.995, 8.8 and 15.4 GHz. The index is lowe r than 1 all
 along the impulsive phase. The spectral index of the optical ly thick gyrosyn-
 chrotron spectrum originated in a homogeneous source is bet ween 2.5 and 2.9
 (Dulk, 1985), independently of the electron index. Therefo re, our result is an
 indication of the presence of an inhomogeneous source.
 The 40 ms integrated time evolution of the ï¬‚ux density at 212 a nd 405 GHz
 during the impulsive phase is shown in the right panel of Figu re 4 (above). The
 bottom of this panel corresponds to the temporal evolution o f the optically
 thin spectral index deduced from these ï¬‚ux densities, the on ly two frequencies
 that are optically thin in our data. During the central part o f the impulsive
 phase (between the dashed lines in the right panel of the Fig. 4), the index is
 close to constant, with gradual transitions at the beginnin g and end. Therefore,

 we can characterize the peak time with only one electron popu lation. Using
 Dulkâ€™s formula (Dulk, 1985), we can estimate the electron en ergy index as
 Î´â‰ˆ3.
 The low spectral resolution of our radio data does not allow u s to obtain a
 unique theoretical ï¬t of the spectrum, i.e. diï¬€erent sets of parameters (mag-
 netic ï¬eld strength, viewing angle, source size, lower and h igher cutoï¬€ ener-
 gies, etc.) give similar results for the optically thin regi on; while, the optically
 thick region is never well ï¬tted, as expected when an inhomog eneous source
 is present.
 4 The 212 GHz gradual phase
 The gradual phase is observed very clearly at 212 GHz (Fig. 5) . At lower fre-
 quencies, after the main burst, new bursting episodes of gyr oemission origin

 The strongest 15.4 GHz feature is also observed at 212 GHz (ar row in Fig. 5).
 Variations in the atmospheric attenuation and/or emission are relatively more
 intense at 405 GHz than at 212 GHz, and thus they modulate the b ackground
 making the free-free emission diï¬ƒcult to observe.
 To test the thermal bremsstrahlung hypothesis we have model led the observed
 emission as an isothermal homogeneous bremsstrahlung sour ce. We integrate

 to subtract the contribution from other emission mechanism s, like gyrosyn-
 chrotron; therefore, we choose an interval that does not sho w strong gyroemis-
 sion. To determine the size of the source we have used an image from the Solar
 X-ray Imager (GOES/SXI, Hill et al., 2005; Pizzo et al., 2005 ) (Fig. 7), con-
 sidering the emitting area above 30% of the maximum, which yi elds a source
 size of the order of 40â€. The emission measure and temperatur e of the source
 are determined using the Chianti-based model with coronal a bundances and
 the response of GOES detectors. We ï¬t the expected emission t o the observed
 data, having as free parameters the source size and the sourc e depth and we
 include a multiplicative factor Î¶. The time proï¬le of the gradual emission at
 212 GHz must be ï¬tted simultaneously. We have obtained the be st ï¬t with
 a source size of 28â€, 8 .4 108cm depth and Î¶= 7.5. Figures 5 and 6 show
 the results. The temporal evolution of the model is remarkab ly similar to the
 gradual phase of the 212 GHz emission. Moreover, the modelle d spectrum fol-
 lows the observed one.

 where ÎºÎ½is the absorption coeï¬ƒcient, His the depth of the source and â„¦

 Therefore, if we want to explain the observed spectrum, the p roduct Tâ„¦ of

 cally thick and optically thin regimes, we conclude that the source is neither
 homogeneous nor isothermal. Similar results for the gradua l phase of other
 events were obtained by LÂ¨ uthi et al. (2004) at submillimete r wavelengths, and
 by Chertok et al. (1995) and Sui et al. (2005) in microwaves.
 5 Conclusions
 In this work we have presented a multiwavelength analysis of a GOES X1 class
 ï¬‚are, including radio data, SXR and EUV images. Radio observ ations cover
 the range between 1.4 and 405 GHz, but we have no observations between 15.4
 and 212 GHz. At 212 GHz, the event has two distinct phases: imp ulsive and
 gradual. At microwave frequencies, there is a second impuls ive phase whose
 emission at submillimeter frequencies is barely observed.
 We ï¬nd that the optically thin spectral index Î±is almost constant during the
 central part of the impulsive phase, afterwards there is a ha rdening. A transi-
 tion to free-free emission, that in the optically thin regim e has an almost null
 index, can explain the change of Î±.
 The gradual phase observed at 212 GHz can be explained by brem sstrahlung
 from a thermal source. The similarity of the temporal evolut ion of the emission
 coming from an isothermal bremsstrahlung source (with EMandTdeduced
 from SXR data) and the ï¬‚ux density at 212 GHz, sustains this hy pothesis.
 Nonetheless, either the EMmust be higher or Tmust be smaller to ï¬t the
 observations. On the contrary, to ï¬t to the microwave observ ations, the prod-
 uctTâ„¦ must be larger. Therefore, the thermal source cannot be hom ogeneous.
 The use of submillimeter frequencies in the analysis of burs t phenomena opens
 new windows to understand the earlier stages of a ï¬‚are at high energies, which
 are hard to observe with HXR detectors, and the late stages of the ï¬‚are, where
 the thermal bremsstrahlung is normally optically thin and m ore intense than
 at microwave frequencies.
