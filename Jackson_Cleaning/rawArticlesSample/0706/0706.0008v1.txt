 1 Introduction
 A hundred years ago the life of one of the most proliï¬c and inï¬‚u ential of XIX centuryâ€™s
 physicists came to a tragic end. It has long been discussed by historians and biographers
 the many reasons why Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann decided to put a n end to his life while
 on vacation in Duino [12,15]. After all, notwithstanding th e many controversies which
 ragedabout hisworkandthemanyattacks hehadtoharness, hi scareer hadbeenabrilliant
 one: at the age of 25 already a full professor in Graz, by the en d of his life he had been
 appointed tochairs of many distinguished universities, an d once even refused changing his
 family name to the noble â€˜von Boltzmannâ€™ with the argument th at â€œif our rather middle-
 class name has been enough for my ancestors, it should remain so for my children and
 grandchildren â€ [13]. While gathering the admiration of many of his contemp oraries, some
 did not fully understand his contributions to Statistical M echanics, whose foundations he
 helped establish along with R. Clausius, J.C. Maxwell and pa rticularly J.W. Gibbs, whom
 he greatly admired [9]. Highly regarded in his native Austri a, he travelled extensively
 overseas. His very spirited account of a trip to the United St ates also shows a man of keen
 observational powers and agreat sense of humor [10].
 Here I would like to discuss another facet of Boltzmann, name ly that of an advocate of
 Technology in the mirror of Aviation. Asit happens with many other giants of science, the
 contributions theyaremostly remembered for usually overs hadow other fundamental ones.2 SÂ´ Ä±lvio R.Dahmen

 drodynamics paleincomparison tohisMechanics, Gravitati on andOptics[31], forreasons
 I will discuss shortly since they are directly related to the theme of this essay. By the same
 token, Boltzmannâ€™s experimental contributions to Eletromagnetism have only received the
 attention they deserved in the last few years [12,13,33]. Th ese works, albeit important,
 are seen as secondary to his contributions to Statistical Me chanics. They do however show
 us a different picture of Boltzmann: that of a ï¬rst-rate expe rimental physicist tuned to the
 technological challenges of his times.
 Myanalysis isbasedonthelecture â€œ Â¨UberLuftschiffahrtâ€1hedeliveredduring the66th
 Annual Meeting of the German Society of Natural Scientists a nd Physicians held in Vi-
 enna in 1894 [11]. Boltzmann was well aware of his stature in t he scientiï¬c community
 and seized the opportunity presented by such aprivileged ve nue to passionately defend the
 brooding ï¬eldofAeronautics. Thisisalsoconï¬rmedbyhisco rrespondence withgreat avi-
 ation pioneers of his time, particularly Otto Lilienthal. I argue that more than representing
 apassing fancyofamanimbuedbytheprevailing Zeitgeist, thelecture showsBoltzmannâ€™s
 deep concern with the funding of applied research and his att itute towards Technology as
 an inseparable companion tobasic research.
 In thenext section I discuss the general context of Boltzman nâ€™s early involvement with
 experimental problems andthesituation ofAeronautics at t hat time, bothexperimental and
 theoretical. Then I present translations of his correspond ence with two aviation pioneers â€“
 OttoLilienthal and Wilhelm Kress â€“before drawing some conc lusions.
 2 A passionfor gadgets
 Boltzmannâ€™sinvolvement withtechnological questionswas notuncommonforhistimes,an
 agemarkedbygreattechnological advancesandapositivist atmosphere. Inhiscasethough
 it was also closely related to the circumstances of his ï¬rst p rofessorship: while ofï¬cially
 appointed to a chair of Mathematical Physics, Boltzmann was actually responsible for the
 setting up of aGeneral Physics course supposed to meet the ne eds of an expanding univer-
 sity [18]. With the opening of a Medical School in Graz in 1863 , the university authorities
 werefacedwiththechallenge ofofferingnot onlymorechair sonNatural Sciencesbut also
 better ones. Physicswasunder theresponsibility ofKarlHu mmel,anelder facultymember
 whose abilities were not up to the new challenges. A decision was made to create a new
 chair to be occupied by an Extraordinarius2. For political reasons this chair was masked
 under the name of Mathematical Physics, while it actually fo resaw that its holder would
 be responsible for equipping and teaching lab courses. This position was shortly occupied
 until E. Mach, then at Graz, managed to have it changed to an Ordinarius status so that he
 could move from the Mathematics to the Physics chair. Shortl y after doing this Mach left

 for Prague in 1867 and Boltzmann replaced him, two years late r, in a position he was to
 remain for the next 4 years until his return to Vienna3. Moreover, he had a professional
 involvement withexperimental researchasaconsequence of hisvisittoH.vonHelmholtzâ€™s
 Institute in Berlin. Helmholtz, under whose guidance Hertz was introduced to Eletromag-
 netism, was one of the proponents of Maxwellâ€™s Theory in Germ any. Soit wasnatural that
 during his Berlin sojournHelmholtz presented him with problems directly related to t he
 conï¬rmation of Maxwellâ€™s Theory. In Boltzmann the doyenof Physics in Germany found
 fertile ground, for the austrian newcomer had worked on a the sis about the movement of
 charges oncurvedsurfaces duringhisPhDandwaswellacquai nted withMaxwellâ€™sworks,
 someofwhichhetranslated intoGerman(hissupervisor, J.S tefan, wasalsoanadvocate of
 Maxwellian Eletromagnetism) [2].
 Boltzmannâ€™s most important contributions to Eletromagnet ism took place during the
 70â€™s and 80â€™s. His works fall mainly into two lines: on the one hand he conducted exper-
 iments which conï¬rmed Maxwellâ€™s theory, thus anticipating Hertz by 14 years [3]. From
 atheoretical point of view, heworked onthe Hall and Thermoe lectric Effects[7], Diamag-
 netism[5]andwroteabookonMaxwellâ€™sElectromagnetism[8 ],nottomentionthefamous
 Stefan-Boltzmann Law which relates the intensity of the ele tromagnetic radiation emitted
 by a black-body to its temperature [6]. From a total of 31 arti cles he published on Electro-
 magnetism â€“roughly one ï¬fth of his whole scientiï¬c producti on, second only to his output
 inStatistical Mechanics â€“7arepurely experimental anddea l withtherelationship between
 theindex of refraction nof amedium and thedielectric and permeability constants Ç«andÂµ
 respectively [14]. Maxwellâ€™s theory predicted that these q uantities were related through:
 n=âˆšÇ«Âµ . (1)
 Therelevance of this equation should not beunderestimated , for it relates the optical tothe
 electrical and magnetic properties of a substance, one of th e tenets of Maxwellian Eletro-
 magnetism. Starting with sulfur crystals [3] Boltzmann mov ed to a more challenging task:
 tomeasuretheindexofrefractionanddielectricconstant o fsomegases. Sincetheirindexes
 of refraction areequal to 1upto the fourth decimal place, one can only conï¬rm Maxwellâ€™s
 prediction by doing high-precision measurements. Boltzma nn was up to the task and de-
 visednotonlynewandingeniouswaysformeasuringthesequa ntitiesbutalsothenecessary
 equipment. His results, which in some cases are equal to the v alues we use nowadays, can
 be seen inthe following table [4].
 3He would return to Graz in 1876 and remain there for 14 years. B y his own accounts these were the
 happiest years of his life[15].4 SÂ´ Ä±lvio R.Dahmen

 For all these substances the permeability Âµis very close to 1so that Eq. (1) reduces to
 nâˆ¼âˆšÇ«. There is no clear indication in his article as to which kind o f oil he actually
 used. As for swamp gas ( Sumpfgas ) he meant Methane (CH 4), whose index of refraction
 is known to be 1,000443(one should keep in mind that ndepends on the wavelength and
 Boltzmannâ€™s results are valid for the visible spectrum).
 These examples are a clear indication that Boltzmann had act ually an insiderâ€™s knowl-
 edgeofexperimental techniques andconsequently shouldha vebeeninpositiontocritically
 assess the experimental data on the growing but still insipi ent aeronautical literature, as I
 discuss in the next section.
 3 The artof ï¬‚ying
 Boltzmann had a keen interest in Aeronautics and followed cl osely many pioneers in their
 attemptstobuildaï¬‚yingmachine, particularly OttoLilien thal inBerlinandWilhelmKress
 in Vienna. The origins of this fascination of his are hard to t race. It is probably a natural
 consequence of his involvement with still unresolved theor etical questions of Aerodynam-
 ics, particularly the problem of viscosity friction, for on e should not forget that this was
 one of the main problems statistical mechanicists were tryi ng to tackle. His interest might
 have also been stirred by the sheer challenges the practical problem of ï¬‚ying presented, as
 he puts at the beginning of his lecture [11]:
 â€œThenumberofunsuccesful projects inthisï¬eld[Aeronautic s] islegion. How-
 ever, throughout the ages, from the legendary Daedalus to Le onardo da Vinci,
 the greatest minds have delved into this problem. There is no other challenge
 more attractive to Mankind than this one...what about Man, w hose trains can
 overrun thefastest racinghorseandwhoseships, notwithst anding theirgigan-
 tic dimensions, can manouver with such ease and swiftness so as to mock the
 ï¬sh in their art? Wonâ€™t Heever be able to follow thebirds inth e skies?â€
 His role in the development of aeronautics was twofold: on th e one hand he publicly
 championed thecause formorefunding andgovernmental supp ort inthisnewareaofprac-
 tical research, ï¬rst in a lecture and later in a newspaper art icle [25]. On the other hand he
 had amore indirect role: he isnot known to have written anyth eoretical paper onthe topic
 but, aswemayconclude, hestimulated oneofhisassistants t odoso, thustaking part inthe
 controversy around Newtonâ€™s sine-square law (see below for details).Boltzmann and Technology 5
 In1894the Gesellschaft DeutscherNaturforscher und Â¨Arzte,thenoneofthemostpres-
 tigious scientiï¬c societies, convened inViennafor its66t hannual meeting. Boltzmann was
 invited to deliver a lecture. Fully aware of his own stature i n the academic millieuas well
 as the impact of such a gathering might have for those respons ible for scientiï¬c policy,
 he chose to talk about the most recent experiments of Lilient hal, Kress and also Hiram S.
 Maxim,anamericanengineer livinginEngland. Histalkisar eviewofthemostrecentï¬eld
 tests with heavier-than-air ï¬‚ying machines â€“ aerostats had been around for quite a while,
 but Boltzmann dismisses them as unpractical (in terms of mas s transportation), for these
 werestill marred byaseries of disavantages [11]:
 â€œIf one wants a balloon to lift a man to the skies it would need to have a
 volume about a thousand times greater indeed...however the deployment of
 such huge bodies runs counter to their principal characteri stic, that is light
 manouverability. If one wants touse aballoon one has togive upspeed. â€
 From this he concluded that airplanes were the only reasonab le solution to air transporta-
 tion:
 â€œThis was just the ï¬rst step towards the invention of a manouve rable airship.
 However, that one may also use the high speeds needed to overc ome winds as
 a means of carrying loads can be observed in the ï¬‚ight of birds of prey which,
 after reaching high velocities, move through the air almost without beating
 theirwings. Soweareledtoï¬‚yingmachineswhichdonotdepen d ontheliftof
 some gas lighter than air, but which use the kinetic energy of a mechanism to
 carry loads through the skies. â€
 Atthispointhemakeshisheartfelt praiseofLilienthalâ€™sp ioneeringstudieswithgliders,the
 man who set the standards for all future studies in the area. H owever, true to his scientiï¬c
 spirit, he calls his audienceâ€™s attention to what he thought would be the right propulsion
 mechanism an airplane would need: propellers. Lilienthal b elieved that ï¬‚ying machines
 would achieve their goal by imitating birds in their art, i.e.by the beating of wings. He
 conducted extensivestudiesontheproï¬leofbirdsâ€™wings(p articularly storks) anddesigned
 hisglidersâ€™wingsaccordingly. Thiswayhecameclosetothe proï¬lesweusenowadaysand
 was the ï¬rst to realize the importance of a curved wing. The ti tle of his book â€œ The ï¬‚ight
 of birds as foundation for the art of ï¬‚ying â€ leaves little room as to what his beliefs really
 were[30]. Atthis point Boltzmann disagrees however, ashe s ays [11]:
 â€œLift is caused by air resistance acting on a curved surface, a principle Well-
 ner4andLilienthal mostprecisely measured...however thenece ssary horizon-
 tal speed of an airplane can be attained by some sort of beatin g of wings, in
 which case it closely resembles a bird, or bymeans of anairsc rew... .â€
 Notwithstanding the high steem hehad for Lilienthal, he cou ld not fail to point out that
 4Georg Wellner (1846-1909), Czech engineer of austrian orig in, professor at the University of B Ë‡rno
 (BrÂ¨ unn).6 SÂ´ Ä±lvio R.Dahmen
 â€œAccording to Lilienthal the airplane must be divided into tw o halves, which
 move as the wings of a bird when ï¬‚ying. This way one may avoid th e so-
 called slip of the propeller and consequently the power loss due to creation of
 eddies, as Lilienthal believes. This point alone I already d oubt, since through
 the beating of the wings much of the work done when pushing the m down gets
 lostwhenpullingthemupagain,whilewithanairscrewoneop timallyemploys
 the advantageous principle of the inclined plane. Maximâ€™s p ropellers actually
 workwithverylittleslip. Moreover,bydividingtheairpla neintomovableparts
 oneimpairsitssimplicityandstrength. Thebeatingofwing scannotbeattained
 without serious complications and a considerable friction of its parts; it does
 not run smoothly and is not ï¬nely tunable as a propeller. The [ theoretical]
 calculations are also much morecomplicated. â€
 At this point he calls attention upon the little known Wilhel m Kress, his countryman.
 Kressstudies sufferedfrominsufï¬cient funding butinspit eofalldifï¬culties hewasamong
 the ï¬rst to test surface controls on wings (ï¬‚aps and ailerons ) and the use of propellers.
 Boltzmann used all his rethorics and a great deal of patrioti sm to impress his audience on
 what their contrymen could achieve [11]:
 â€œ..how much have Germans achieved with sparse means but [only through]
 the acuteness of their minds! Who dares question this, here i n Vienna, the
 place where the Magic Flute, the Missa Solemnis and the Ninth Symphony
 werecomposed? Letthe whole wide world tryimitating us, if t hey can!â€
 Rather then showing an ingrained chauvinism of Boltzmann, t his statement seems more of
 arethorical technique tocaptivate hisaudience. Ashesaid , theyshould dosomething forit
 they did not the British would beat them inthis race:
 â€œ...I contemplate proposing to the ï¬nance committe of our new ly founded Nat-
 ural Society, which is actually still sort of dangling in the air, to do something
 for air travel with their ï¬rst available funds and, if money i s not enough, to
 convince the government to doso. â€
 To make his cause more impressive Boltzmann brought along a s mall prototype of an
 airplane built by Kress, whose design, he emphasized, was al ready 14-years old. He made
 the prototype ï¬‚y across the room, to the great amusement of hi s audience. According to a
 witness, the plane ï¬‚ewacross thelarge auditorium, â€œ landing inthe armsof alady â€ [26].
 Boltzmann had, like few men of his time, travelled extensive ly through the european
 continent and visited the United States twice. He also follo wed his son Arthur on a cruise
 through the Mediterranean, while this was working on his PhD thesis. This certainly made
 him aware of the advantages air travel would bring [11]:
 â€œIt is undeniable how immense the jump in transportation woul d be if one had
 manouverable airships, comparedtowhichrailroads andshi pswouldnoteven
 come close .â€Boltzmann and Technology 7
 From a theoretical point of view Boltzmann also had a few comm ents to make. It was
 believedthataheavier-than-air machinecouldnotï¬‚y,anar gumentmosttheoreticianstraced
 all the way back to Newton. In Book II of his Principia Newton dealt with the resistance
 bodies experienced whenmoving through aï¬‚uid[31]. ForNewt onit wasimportant to ï¬nd
 an argument against the cartesian view that the Universe was ï¬lled with matter through
 which forces were transmitted. If true, this would imply tha t planets should experience a
 resistance to their movement around the sun. Newtonâ€™s motiv es were thus of a more fun-
 damental character, not a practical one. In proposition 33he asserts that bodies moving
 through a ï¬‚uid â€œ undergo a resistance in a ratio compounded by the ratio of the square of
 their velocities, the ratio of the square of their diameters and a simple ratio of their densi-
 ties.â€ Inmodern parlance thismeansthat theaerodynamic force a bodymoving through air
 would experience is5

 wereÏisthedensity, Aisthecross-sectional areaand vthevelocity. Bytheendofthe19th
 Centurythisformula wastheoretically andexperimentally welljustiï¬ed. Basedonamodel
 of a ï¬‚uid as a collection of particles, Newton was able to dete rmine FA(proposition 34) in
 the form:
 FA=ÏAv2sin2Î¸ . (3)
 This is the famous sine-square law where Î¸is Newtonâ€™s â€˜angle of incidenceâ€™ (nowadays
 called the angle of attack). Adapting it to awingin the form o f aï¬‚at plate withan angle of
 attack Î¸one can ï¬ndthe lift and drag components of FAthrough the relations:
 D=FAsinÎ¸=ÏAv2sin3Î¸
 L=FAcosÎ¸=ÏAv2sin2Î¸cosÎ¸ , (4)
 These equations are the reason why so many physicists were ve ry pessimistic about
 the feasibility of an airplane ï¬‚ying: if one were to increase lift, it would be necessary to
 increasetheangleofattack. Butthiswouldinturnleadtoam uchfasterincreaseindrag(or,
 which is the same, a rapid decrease in the ratio L/D=cotan Î¸). In other words the drag
 would become so large as to hinder ï¬‚ight. The predictions bas ed on Newtonâ€™s arguments
 are wrong because of his treatment of a ï¬‚uid as individual par ticles. In 1897 Gustav JÂ¨ ager,
 who had previously worked with Stefan, became Boltzmannâ€™s a ssistant. Boltzmann took
 him under his wing and saw to it that JÂ¨ ager get a position of Extraordinarius in Vienna.
 During his ï¬rst year there JÂ¨ ager published a paper entitled â€˜On the resistance that bodies
 experience when moving through liquids and gasesâ€™6. According to HÂ¨ oï¬‚echner, this work
 5In Aeronautics one speaks of three forces acting on a plane: i ts weight, a traction provided by the engines
 andanaerodynamic force. Theaerodynamic forceisusuallyd ecomposedintotwootherforces: lift Landdrag
 D, which act perpendicular and parallel to the direction of ï¬‚i ght respectively.The modern relations for drag
 and lift closely resemble Newtonâ€™s formula: D=1

 received a lot of attention also because of the fact that Bolt zmann highly praised it. The
 reason for Boltzmannâ€™s enthusiasm was that this paper refut ed Newton and the ï¬ndings of
 a commission headed by H. Helmholtz according to which it wou ld be impossible for any
 machine heavier than air to ï¬‚y [28]. However as late as 1906, t he year of Boltzmannâ€™s
 death, his colleague Franz Exner still expressed his doubts in an ofï¬cial report about the
 feasibility of anairplane [26].
 Aninterestingâ€˜effectâ€™ofBoltzmannâ€™sdealingswithAeron auticswasthathissonArthur
 became a balloonist and later wrote an article on the resista nce of curved surfaces moving
 through the air [1]. This work deals mainly with experimenta l results on the pressure dis-
 tribution on curved surfaces in thepresence of anair ï¬‚ow.
 4 Boltzmannâ€™scorrespondence
 Boltzmann correspondence with Otto Lilienthal and Wilhelm Kress can be attested by the
 few letters which survived. What seems to have motivated his correspondence with Lilien-
 thal was his need for more detailed information on Lilientha lâ€™s studies while preparing his
 lecture. Boltzmanncertainly knewofhisworkfromhismanyv isitstoBerlinandhadprob-
 ably read Lilienthalâ€™s inï¬‚uential book of 1889. Lilienthal was trained as an engineer and
 after successfully getting the patent rights for a few of his inventions, he was able to more
 completely dedicate himself to his aeronautical studies. W hat characterizes his pioneer-
 ing work is the combination of detailed theoretical studies with ï¬eld tests. He paciently
 improved his gliders step-by-step, correcting minor desig n ï¬‚aws and testing them exhaus-
 tively. The ï¬rst known letter of Lilienthal to Boltzmann in t he autumn of 1894 was an
 answer to aletter Boltzmann had sent to him [20]:
 Dear Prof. LudwigBoltzmann, Vienna
 It took me a while to reply to your kind letter since I was waiti ng until I could
 send you copies of my most recent articles on the technique of ï¬‚ight. I just
 happened to read in the newspaper that you already gave a talk , whose re-
 port I followed with great interest. In the meantime allow me to send you two
 morearticles whereI discuss propellers, which you mention at the end of your
 letter. The October issue of Prometheus7will carry an article of mine with
 illustrations of myexperimental ï¬‚ight station inthe vicin ities of Berlin8.

 Mydear Sir,
 I thank you very much for the sending of your excellent book on the theory of
 sound9, as well as the synopsis of the article on Mr. Maxim, both of wh ich I
 got while inMunich.
 With the utmost respect, truly yours ... Ludwig Boltzmann.
 On November 6 1894 Lilienthal replied to another letter he go t from Boltzmann. From his
 answer wemayconclude that Boltzmann wasinterested in buyi ng one of hisgliders [22]:
 Dear Prof. Boltzmann, Vienna
 It would much please me to send you a light machine. However I n eed some
 more detailed information on your purposes. The light engin es I build are all
 based on the stroking principle since, in my opinion, circul ar movements lead
 toagreat loss of power. HoweverIbelieve you want anengine w itharotatory
 motion.
 In case you want to test it for a short time, so that a few minute s sufï¬ce, I
 would advise you to use an engine running on liquid carbon dio xide. It exerts
 apressure of 60atm. andsmall bottles provide great power. T hat wayyoucan
 get agreat concentration of power in short times.
 I thank you for the news. Yours truly ... Otto Lilienthal.
 What Lilienthal meant by â€˜strokingâ€™ movement was a new princ iple he wanted to apply to
 a prototype he had just built. In the winter of of 1893/1894 he devised a ï¬‚ying machine
 with movable parts. True to the principles expounded in his b ook, Lilienthal believed that
 ï¬‚ight would be achieved by imitating birds, i.e.by the beating of wings as a means of
 propulsion [32]. Boltzmann however was certain that the bes t solution would be to use
 a propeller (the circular or rotatory movement Lilienthal m entions), a principle defended
 by Kress. Notwithstanding these differences in opinion, it seems that Boltzmann really
 meant buying one of Lilienthalâ€™s prototypes. This is attest ed by a letter of November 21
 where he asks Lilienthal to make a price proposal [23]. On Dec ember 10 Lilienthal ï¬nally
 answered [24]:
 Dear Prof.,
 in reply to your kind letter of [November] 21 I did some quick c alculations as
 to how a rotatory machine, that is a machine with a rotating en gine, could be
 assembled. I would build a three-cylinder engine, of which o nly one would be
 directly fed with carbon dioxide. This way one would get a tri ple expansion
 without dead point. This engine, which in a 10-cycle-per-se cond regime pro-
 ducesoneHPeffective, wouldnotweighmorethan2kg. Tohave itrunningfor

 10minutesitwouldbenecessary tocarry5kgofgasandthewho leequipment
 would weigh about 25 kg. I estimate the price of this machine a t about 1,000
 Marks.
 Respectfully yours ... OttoLilienthal.
 The engine Lilienthal refers to was a normal stroke (piston) engine fueled by pressurized
 CO210. Asit wasathree-stroke engine Lilienthal proposed combin ing three ofthem toget
 atriple expansion without deadpoint . Boltzmann most certainly did not buy theprototype,
 as Lilienthalâ€™s company records do not list him among its cli ents [32]. Moreover such an
 unusual purchase would not go unrecorded (the famous physic ist George FitzGerald not
 only had of one of Lilienthalâ€™s gliders but also tested it in D ublin. Another famous client
 was Nikolai Zhukovsky, the father of russian aviation who vi sited Lilienthal on different
 occasions).
 WenowcometoBoltzmannâ€™snextpublicmanifest. Thiswasale ttersenttothenewspa-
 perNeuesWienerTagblatt andpublished onJuly101896, wherehemakesreference tohis
 acclaimed lecture of 1894. From its content one concludes th at critiques on the feasibility
 of Kressâ€™s prototype surfaced [25]:
 I have already expressed mystrong conviction during the Con gress of Natural
 Scientists in Vienna that, among all manouverable ï¬‚ying app aratuses, gliders
 are those which have the highest chance of becoming successf ul. Maxim did
 buildaï¬‚yingmachinethattookoffwithpeopleonboard,buth edidnotsucceed
 in solving the stability problem. His machine dropped sudde nly, risking the
 lives of all those in it.
 However a solution to this problem had already been found lon g ago by Mr.
 Kress from Vienna. I just became aware of it immediately afte r my lecture.
 It is true that he managed to get [stability] on a small-scale model, which
 he actually most successfully demonstrated during my talk. Now doubts have
 arisen as to whether this stability can be attained for large r models. Against
 these opinions I would like to say that this must be even simpl er, once the
 necessary resources for their construction are made availa ble. My opinion is
 conï¬rmed by recent experiments of Langley: he built a glider which, in spite
 of not being able to carry a man, was much larger than Kressâ€™s. This was
 only possible because instead of using rubber bands11, he used a marvelous
 and light 1 1/2 HP-steam engine. According to his own reports and that of
 Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, we mus t believe that
 Langley really got enough stability. His model does not seem much different
 from that of Kress. I believe that Mr. Kress will get a stable m odel by means
 of careful reasoning. Langley already plans to build a large r one. After these

 and thiswill certainly take place inAmerica incase myplea f orthesupport of

 To avoid misunderstandings, I would like to note that whatev er one accom-
 plishes, it wonâ€™t be a manouverable airplane for practical u se yet. However,
 it will be the most fundamental and important step toward thi s goal. Only

 The last document is a letter of Kress dated August 12 1896. Kr ess thanks Boltzmann
 for this article but at the same time criticizes him for being , according to Kress, over-
 cautious. One cannot fail to notice, at the end of the letter, a certain pleading attitute of
 Kress [27]:
 Most steemed Privy Counsellor,
 I would like to thank you immensely for the clear and most favo rable arti-
 cle of yours regarding my endeavors [published] on the 10th o f this month
 in the Neues Wiener Tagblatt. However the last sentence â€˜to a void misunder-
 standingsâ€™ showsonceagainyourcaution andunnecessarily dampsapossible
 growing enthusiasm for gliders. This sentence certainly do es not come from
 yourveryheart, foronenoticesacoldness opposite tothepa ssionate tonepre-
 viously employed. The opponents of gliders, who think they c ould do better,
 could hold themselves to these very last words. At the same ti me prospective
 ï¬nancial supporters couldbecomeawry,forwhointhesedays giveshismoney
 away for purely idealistic goals? I have just read in Lâ€™Aeron aute12that M.
 Kane from Chicago is building 3 different types of gasoline e ngines following
 Deningtonâ€™s design:
 1HPweighing 13 kg.
 2HPwith 18kg or1 HPwith9kg.
 4HPwith 22kg or1 HPwith5kg.
 Theinteresting point about thesemodelsisthattheydonotr equirewatercool-
 ing and need only half a liter of gasoline per hour per HP. I wil l ask Chanute
 in Chicago about it. Bythe way, I would like to say once more th at if I had the
 necessary [ï¬nancial] means I would quickly acquire a light e ngine to make a
 glider ï¬‚y.
 Most respectfully yours... Wilhelm Kress.

 An answer to this letter is unknown. Kress does not seem to hav e been that fair with
 Boltzmann since, asKress attests inhis ownbook [29], from 1 895 onwards hecould count
 on military as well asBoltzmannâ€™s ownï¬nancial support.
 Had Boltzmann lived to see airplanes ï¬‚ying, he would probabl y be sad to see that the
 words he said at the beginning of his talk in Vienna would unfo rtunately become real-
 ity [11]:
 â€œOur modern armies would stand as much a chance against an iron airplane,
 ï¬‚ying by unassailable, dropping dynamite from the heights, as a roman army
 would have against abattery of cannons. â€
 Right at the end of histalk Boltzmann concludes:
 â€œOnly a ï¬rst-rate genius can solve the problem [of airplane ma nouverability].
 And this inventor, besides being a genius, must also be a hero ; not without
 great effort will the elements to be harnessed give up their s ecrets. Only those
 who have the courage to trust their lives to these new element s, cunningly
 circumventing itscaveats, willstandachanceofvictoryov erthedragonwhich
 hides the treasures of this discovery from mankind. â€
 Two years after these words Otto Lilienthal, whom Boltzmann highly praised, died as a
 consequence of an accident while on one of his routine ï¬‚ights . Unfortunately there is no
 recordsofBoltzmannonthisuntimelydeath,ashisownuntim elydeathpreventedhimfrom
 seeing his dream become reality.
 5 Conclusions
 As the historian of science A. Vucinich once wrote, we must be careful not to exaggerate
 the role of socio-cultural conditions in stimulating scien tiï¬c discoveries [34]. However,
 technological advances are to a great measure dictated by th e needs of society and science
 may grow as a response to technological challenges. Accordi ng to Vucinich â€œ ... No com-
 petent scientist would deny the essentially utilitarian qu ality of scientiï¬c knowledge; but
 none would go on to argue that the scientiï¬c community should concern itself exclusively
 with solving the acute problems of the day â€ [34]. These words could well have been said
 byBoltzmannhimself. Hehadaprofound interest inthetechn ological developments ofhis
 times, particularly aviation, an interest which in my opini on went beyound that of an edu-
 cated scientist. As I argued in this essay, when the opportun ity presented itself for him to
 intervene publicly and promote aviation he did not waver: he lectured a highly prestigious
 audience in1894andsentalettertwoyearslatertoViennaâ€™s important NeuesWienerTage-
 blatturgingauthoritiestoprovidemorefundinglestAmericabea tAustriaintherace. From
 the point of view of basic research he supported his assistan t Gustav JÂ¨ ager who published
 an article countering the accepted view that heavier-than- air machines could not ï¬‚y and
 probably was responsible for his son Arthurâ€™s later involve ment with Aerodynamics. HisBoltzmann and Technology 13
 ideas in Physics were revolutionary, but so was his belief in Aviation: when time came for
 him to openly position himself against the majority who did n ot believe that ï¬‚ying would
 one day become reality, he did sowithout hesitation.

 Lilienthal Museum in Anklam, Germany, kindly sent me materi al on O. Lilienthal and a
 copy of A. Boltzmannâ€™s article. All translations from the or iginal texts are my own. This
 article is an extended and revised version of an essay I wrote in Portuguese during the
 celebration of Boltzmannâ€™s Year (2006) which waspublished in [14].
