 Abstract
 We present self consistent calculations of Synchrotron sel f Compton (SSC) radiation
 that takes place within the afterglow blast wave and Externa l inverse Compton (EIC)
 radiation that takes place when ï¬‚are photons (produced by an internal process) pass
 through the blast wave. We show that if our current interpret ations of the Swift
 XRT data are correct, there should be a canonical high energy afterglow emission
 light curve. We expect that GRBs with a long term X-ray ï¬‚atten ing or X-ray ï¬‚ares
 should show similar high energy features. The EIC emission, however, is long lasting
 and weak and might be outshined by the SSC emission of the forw ard shock. The
 high energy emission could be well detected by the soon to be l aunched GLAST
 satellite. Its detection could shed new light on the conditi ons within the emitting
 regions of GRBs.

 1 Introduction
 Very high energy emission provides
 us with another window on the con-
 dition within the emitting region in
 Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs). Such a
 window is very important in view of
 the present confusion between dif-
 ferent modiï¬cations to the standard
 afterglow model proposed to explain
 the recent observation of Swift. The
 upcoming high energy observatory
 1Supported by the US-Israel BSF.GLAST is an ideal tool to detect such
 emission. Together with the SwiftX-
 ray Telescope (XRT), it would pro-
 vide a very wide band monitoring of
 the afterglow that might enable us
 to distinguish between the diï¬€erent
 models. We discuss here several pre-
 dictions of current models for the ex-
 pected high energy light curves and
 their relation to the X-ray afterglow.

 2 SSC emission of the forward
 shock
 The dominant source of long lasting
 high energy GRB afterglow emis-
 sion is SSC of the hot electrons in
 the forward external shock. At early
 stages of the afterglow when the cool-
 ing of most electrons is important,
 the luminosity of the SSC emission,
 LSSC, is related to the luminosity of
 the synchrotron radiation, Lsyn, as
 LSSCâˆ¼Y Lsyn, where Yis the Comp-
 ton parameter. The X-ray luminos-
 ityLX, is a small fraction of Lsyn.
 We would like to use it as a proxy
 for the total luminosity and we de-
 ï¬ne a factor Ç«Xâ‰¡LX/Lsynso that
 LSSCâˆ¼Y LX/Ç«X. A wide band SSC
 afterglow data and the X-ray data
 will have quite similar temporal be-
 haviors, as long as Ç«Xdoes not vary
 signiï¬cantly with time. Overall we
 expect, therefore, that LXandLSSC
 should be highly correlated. In other
 words, the GRBs with slowly decay-
 ing X-ray light curve should show
 similar high energy feature. This is
 conï¬rmed by the more detailed anal-ysis (Fan et al. 2007; Wei & Fan
 2007) and by the numerical results,
 as shown in Fig.1.
 Energy injection and time increasing
 Ç«e, have been proposed to explain the
 slowly declining X-ray phase seen in
 many GRB afterglows. The result-
 ing SSC light curves in both cases
 follow the X-ray. Although the SSC
 light curves are somewhat diï¬€erent
 the diï¬€erence is probably too small
 to distinguish between the two mod-
 iï¬cations (Fan et al. 2007). However,

 dence suggests a signiï¬cant diï¬€erence
 in the time evolution of the high en-
 ergy spectrum between the two mod-
 els.
 3 Possible high energy emis-
 sion associated with ï¬‚ares
 X-ray ï¬‚ares during the afterglow
 have been detected by BeppoSAX
 (Piro et al. 2005) and conï¬rmed by
 Swift to exist in a large fraction of
 the afterglows (Nousek et al. 2006;
 Zhang et al. 2006). Such ï¬‚ares should
 be accompanied by a high energy
 emission either because of SSC emis-
 sion of the electrons powering the
 ï¬‚ares or because EIC upscattering

 GeV ï¬‚ash. We consider ï¬rst the
 direct SSC emission associated with
 X-ray ï¬‚ares. The typical frequency
 of the upscattered X-ray photons
 depends on the Lorentz factor of
 2the scattering electrons. The mag-
 netic energy density ( B) at a ra-
 dius Rï¬‚arecan be estimated as:
 Bâˆ¼250 Gauss Îµ1/2L1/2

 the magnetic ï¬eld the peak energy

 The total ï¬‚uence of the SSC emission
 of the ï¬‚are shock is comparable to
 that of the X-ray emission, typically
 10âˆ’7âˆ¼10âˆ’6erg cmâˆ’2. In a late inter-
 nal shock with Rï¬‚areâˆ¼1015cm (Fan
 & Wei 2005), a GeV ï¬‚ash accompa-
 nying the X-ray ï¬‚are is possible (Wei
 et al. 2006, however see Wang et al.
 2006). In an external shock, a GeV-
 TeV ï¬‚ash is predicted (see also Galli
 & Piro 2007).
 Extended EIC emission. A sec-
 ond source of high energy emission
 arises when X-ray ï¬‚are photons that
 are produced by internal energy dis-
 sipation are be inverse Compton
 upscattered by the external shockâ€™s
 hot electrons. A central ingredient of
 this scenario is that in the rest frame
 of the blast wave, the seed photons
 are highly beamed. We take care of
 this eï¬€ect, following the analysis of
 Aharonian & Atoyan (1981).
 If the EIC emission duration is com-
 parable to that of the X-ray ï¬‚are, theEIC luminosity can be estimated by
 Lelnâˆ¼1049erg sâˆ’1Ç«e,âˆ’1Ek,53tâˆ’1
 3.(2)
 In the rest frame of the shocked mate-
 rial, the EIC emission peaks at Î¸sc=
 Ï€and it vanishes for small scatter-
 ing angles. This eï¬€ect lowers the high
 energy ï¬‚ux signiï¬cantly in two ways.
 First, a fraction of the total energy is
 emitted out of our line of sight and
 thus the received power is depressed
 (relative to the isotropic seed photon
 case). Second, the strongest emission
 is from Î¸âˆ¼1/Î“ (Fan & Piran 2006).
 Thus, the high energy EIC emission
 will be delayed by
 Tpâˆ¼(4âˆ’k)tf, (3)
 after the ï¬‚are (emitted at tf). AsTp
 is much longer than âˆ† T, the duration
 of the soft X-ray ï¬‚are the EIC high
 energy ï¬‚ux would be low:

 A comparison of the EIC high en-
 ergy component with the SSC emis-
 sion from the forward shock my ren-

 100-1000sec after the burst, the for-
 ward shock emission peaks in far-UV
 to soft X-ray band. The correspond-

 shock around tfisLSSCâˆ¼LelnY/(1 +

 LEICand the wide EIC ï¬‚are would be
 undetectable (cf. Wang et al. 2006).
 In special cases the EIC component
 might still be detectable. This hap-

 pens for bursts having a weak SSC
 emission and in which the forward
 shock electrons are in slow cooling
 (before the X-ray ï¬‚are phase). The
 energy of these electrons will be lost
 mainly in the EIC process and in
 this case the EIC luminosity will be
 enhanced. If the EIC emission dom-
 inates over the SSC emission, the
 high energy light curve will ï¬‚atten,
 as shown in Fig.2. Such a ï¬‚attening
 could also arise by energy injection
 or due to an increasing Ç«e. However,
 as shown in last section, in these two
 scenarios, the X-ray and the high
 energy emission behaviors are quite
 similar and ï¬‚attening should be ap-
 parent also in the X-ray signal. The
 EIC emission should, on the other
 hand show an X-ray ï¬‚are preceding
 high energy emission and not accom-
 panying ï¬‚at X-ray light curve.
 A numerical example illustrating the
 possible EIC emission following the
 X-ray ï¬‚are in GRB 050502B is shown
 in Fig.2.

 glow signatures (the lower panel), cor-

 data (Fan et al. 2007).
 4 Summary and Discussion
 We have shown that if the current
 interpretation of the SwiftXRT data
 (the upper panel of Fig.3) is correct
 there should be a canonical high en-
 ergy afterglow light curve (see the
 lower panel of Fig.3 for illustration).
 A detection of such a high energy
 component will enable us to test
 current models of GRBs and their
 afterglow. A high energy component
 that follows the lower energy light
 curve will conï¬rm that the low en-
 ergy component is Synchrotron. If
 the lower component is produced via
 Inverse Compton the Klein-Nishina
 suppression will prevent a second
 upscattering. A detailed compari-
 son of the high energy and the low
 energy light curves, in particular
 during the shallow decline phase,
 might even enable us to distinguish
 between diï¬€erent modiï¬cations of
 the standard afterglow model. This
 4is because for the two most widely
 considered models, the energy injec-
 tion and time increasing Ç«e, the time
 evolution of the high energy spec-
 tra are very diï¬€erent. A long lasting
 high energy component that follows
 a low energy ï¬‚are would prove the
 internal origin of this ï¬‚are and the
 EIC model for the origin of the high
 energy emission. The upcoming high
 energy observatory GLAST can thus
 play a key role in exploring the GRB
 afterglow physics.
