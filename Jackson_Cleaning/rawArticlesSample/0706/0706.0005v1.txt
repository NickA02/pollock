 GRAVITATIONAL STABILITY OF CIRCUMNUCLEAR DISKS IN ELLIPTI CAL GALAXIES

 Draft version August 11, 2013
 ABSTRACT
 A signiï¬cant fraction of nearby elliptical galaxies are kno wn to have high-density gas disks in their
 circumnuclear (CN) region (0.1 to a few kpc). Yet, elliptica ls, especially luminous ones, show little
 signs of recent star formation. To investigate the possible cause of the dearth of star formation in
 these systems, we study the gravitational stability of CN ga s disks embedded within the gravitational
 potentials of both the stellar bulge component and the centr al massive black hole (BH) in elliptical
 galaxies. We ï¬nd that CN disks in higher mass galaxies are gen erally more stable than those in
 lower mass galaxies, because higher mass galaxies tend to ha ve more massive BHs and more centrally
 concentrated stellar density proï¬les. We also consider the case in which the central stellar density
 proï¬le has a core, which is often observed for ellipticals wh ose total stellar mass is higher than about
 1011MâŠ™. Such a cored stellar density proï¬le leads to more unstable C N disks than the power-law
 stellar density proï¬le characteristic of less massive gala xies. However, the more massive BHs in high-
 mass galaxies act to stabilize the CN disk. Our results demon strate that the gravitational potentials
 ofboththe central BH and the stellar component should be taken into account when studying the
 properties of CN disks, as their stability is sensitive to bo th the BH mass and the stellar density
 proï¬le. Our results could explain the observed trend that le ss luminous elliptical galaxies have a
 greater tendency to exhibit ongoing star formation than gia nt ellipticals.

 1.INTRODUCTION
 Elliptical galaxies were believed to be completely dor-
 mant and therefore to consist of old stellar populations,
 due to the galactic wind which had blown the gas out
 and stopped star formation (Johnson & Axford 1971;
 Mathews & Baker 1971; Faber & Gallagher 1976). The
 discovery of an X-ray-emitting hot interstellar medium
 (ISM) in these objects has dramatically renewed our view
 of their physical properties and formation history (e.g.,
 Forman et al. 1979, 1985). Warm gas is also detected in
 a signiï¬cant fraction of ellipticals (55% âˆ’60%), although
 the estimated mass is small (103âˆ’104MâŠ™) (Phillips et al.
 1986; Ho et al. 1997a). In addition, multiwavelength ob-
 servations from optical to radio reveal the existence of
 the fair amount of H Igas (e.g., Knapp et al. 1985; Breg-
 man et al. 1992; Huchtmeier 1994; Knapp 1999; Morganti
 et al. 2006), dust (e.g., Knapp et al. 1989; van Dokkum &
 Franx 1995; Wiklind & Henkel 1995; Tomita et al. 2000;
 Colbert et al. 2001; Tran et al. 2001; Martel et al. 2004),
 and molecular gas (e.g., Wiklind et al. 1995; Knapp &
 Rupen 1996; Vila-VilarÂ´ o et al. 2003; Young 2005; Nakan-
 ishi et al. 2007) in a signiï¬cant fraction of ellipticals. Pa r-
 ticularly, some of the cold gas appears as a disk at the
 center of the galaxies. High-resolution images with Hub-
 ble Space Telescope (HST) uncovered that the majority
 of elliptical galaxies possess such dusty cold disks, with
 a typical mass of 104âˆ’106MâŠ™and sizes of 100 âˆ’500 pc
 (e.g., Tomita et al. 2000). Molecular gas disks are also
 observed in the central region, with estimated masses of
 106âˆ’109MâŠ™and extents up to a few kpc (Knapp 1999;

 Peyton Hall, Ivy Lane, Princeton, NJ 08544Okuda et al. 2005; Young 2005; Nakanishi et al. 2007). In
 this paper we call such observed central cold structures
 â€œcircumnuclearâ€ (CN) disks. So far, there is no evidence
 of a correlation between the mass of the CN disk and
 the total stellar mass of ellipticals (e.g., van Dokkum &
 Franx 1995).
 The estimated densities of the CN disks are relatively
 high. CN disks in gas-rich disk galaxies obviously har-
 bor star formation (e.g., Phillips et al. 1986; Ho et al.
 1997b; Koda et al. 2005). However, it is still a matter
 of debate whether or not the CN disks in ellipticals have
 star formation. Ho et al. (1997a, 2003) and Ho (2005)
 suggest that there is no clear evidence of star formation
 in the central region of bright elliptical galaxies. On the
 other hand, Phillips et al. (1986) show that less luminous
 ellipticals tend to have star formation. It also seems that
 the properties of the ISM of ellipticals depend on galaxy
 mass: the detection rates of H Iand molecular gas are
 higher in less luminous galaxies (Lake & Schommer 1984;
 Lees et al. 1991; Sadler et al. 2000; Sage et al. 2007).
 Okuda et al. (2005) measured the density and rotation of
 the CN disk in the radio galaxy 3C 31, and suggest that
 its disk is stable against local gravitational instability ,
 consistent with the lack of evidence for star formation
 in this system (Owen et al. 1990). Young (2005) also
 performed a similar analysis for NGC 83 and NGC 2320.
 Therefore, the gravitational stability of the disk may be
 a key factor for the star formation condition in the CN
 disk (Kennicutt 1989) (but see also Koda et al. 2005).
 In the central region of elliptical galaxies, there are
 two empirical trends as a function of their mass. One
 is a well-established correlation between the black hole
 (BH) mass and the stellar mass of bulge (Magorrian et al.
 1998; Marconi & Hunt 2003; HÂ¨ aring & Rix 2004). The
 other one is the fact that the central stellar density pro-
 ï¬le loosely depends on the mass of galaxies (Faber et al.2 Kawata, Cen, and Ho
 1997; Ravindranath et al. 2001; Stiavelli et al. 2001; Fer-
 rarese et al. 2006; Lauer et al. 2007). The high-resolution
 images from the HSTenable the measurement of the stel-
 lar density proï¬le in the central region of galaxies (Crane
 et al. 1993; Grillmair et al. 1994; Jaï¬€e et al. 1994; Lauer
 et al. 1995). Faber et al. (1997) suggest two diï¬€erent
 categories for the inner proï¬le of elliptical galaxies: lu-
 minous galaxies have a â€œcoreâ€ and less luminous galaxies
 have a â€œpower-lawâ€ proï¬le without any evidence of a
 core. On the other hand, Ravindranath et al. (2001) and
 Rest et al. (2001) found galaxies with â€œintermediateâ€ in-
 ner proï¬les that cannot be categorized as either cores or
 power laws. Trujillo et al. (2004b) attempt to link the
 central and global proï¬les of early-type galaxies by not-
 ing that the outer proï¬les of ellipticals are well known
 to be ï¬tted by the SÂ´ ersic law ( r1/nlaw SÂ´ ersic 1968), and
 whose index nis well-correlated with the global proper-
 ties of galaxies, such as the eï¬€ective radius and the total
 luminosity (e.g., Caon et al. 1993; Graham & GuzmÂ´ an
 2003). They suggest that the inner power-law proï¬le can
 be explained as the extension of the outer SÂ´ ersic pro-
 ï¬le, except for galaxies with central cores. Therefore,
 among power-law galaxies, the brighter members have
 proï¬les with larger n, and hence steeper power-law slope
 for the inner proï¬le. On the other hand, Trujillo et al.
 (2004b) propose that luminous galaxies with cores can
 be described with a â€œcore-SÂ´ ersicâ€ proï¬le, which is a com-
 bination of a core, approximated as an inner power-law
 proï¬le with a shallow slope, and an outer SÂ´ ersic proï¬le.
 Motivated by these facts, we study the gravitational
 stability of the CN disk for elliptical galaxies with diï¬€er-
 ent masses. The stability of a rotating disk can be de-
 scribed by the so-called Toomreâ€™s Q-parameter (Toomre
 1964; Goldreich & Lynden-Bell 1965). This parameter
 also provides a criterion for star formation in rotating
 disks (e.g., Kennicutt 1989). Tan & Blackman (2005)
 study the stability of the CN disk analytically. They con-
 clude that CN disks are inevitably unstable, and should
 have star formation activity even in giant ellipticals, suc h
 as M87. However, so far, no indication of star formation
 has been observed in M87. Although Tan et al. (2007)
 report the detection of the molecular gas in the central
 region of M87, the optical spectral features of M87â€™s CN
 disk are not consistent with star formation. The nu-
 clear spectrum of M87 shows classical signatures of low-
 ionization nuclear emission-line regions (Ho et al. 1997c) ,
 which as a group are consistent with being active galac-
 tic nuclei (AGNs) accreting at a low rate (Ho et al. 2003;
 Ho 2004).
 The gravitational potential in the CN region is gov-
 erned by the central BH as well as the stars in the inner
 bulge. The study of Tan & Blackman (2005), however,
 ignores the potential of the stellar bulge component. Our
 analysis of the stability of the CN disk in ellipticals takes
 into account both contributions to the potential and their
 dependence on the global mass of the system. Section 2
 summarizes our method to analyze the stability and de-
 scribes models of the CN disk and the stellar potential
 in the CN region. Section 3 shows the results, and in
 Section 4 we discuss how our results ï¬t with the recent
 observed properties of the central region of ellipticals.
 2.METHODThe stability of a self-gravitating disk can be analyzed
 by Toomreâ€™s Q-parameter (Toomre 1964; Goldreich &
 Lynden-Bell 1965). The deï¬nition of Toomreâ€™s Qpa-
 rameter is
 Qâ‰¡csÎº
 Ï€GÎ£d, (1)
 where cs,Îº, and Î£ dare the sound velocity, epicycle fre-
 quency, and surface density of the gas disk. If Q <1,
 the disk is unstable. The speciï¬c frequency for a disk is
 described as
 Îº2=Rdâ„¦2
 dR+ 4â„¦2, (2)
 where â„¦ is the circular frequency.
 We assume that the disk is steady, i.e. the accretion
 rate is the same at diï¬€erent radii. The accretion rate can
 be written as
 Ë™M(R) =âˆ’2Ï€RÎ±acccs[â„¦(R)â€²/â„¦(R)2]Î£d(R) = const .,
 (3)
 where Î±accis the dimensionless viscosity parameter
 (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973; Pringle 1981; Frank et al.
 2002). This allows us to derive the density proï¬le of
 the CN disk, Î£ d(R), once the total mass, Md, and the
 radius, Rd, of the disk are ï¬xed. The circular density
 proï¬le â„¦( R) is determined by the gravitational poten-
 tial. For simplicity, we assume that the gravitational
 potential is dominated by the central BH and the stellar
 component, and that the contribution from the CN disk
 is negligible. We also assume that the stellar density is
 much higher than the dark matter density in the central
 region.
 We examine the stability of the CN disk within the
 potential of the central region of spherical galaxies with
 diï¬€erent total masses of the stellar bulge, Ms. We adopt
 the relation between the BH mass and the stellar mass
 from HÂ¨ aring & Rix (2004),
 log(MBH/MâŠ™) = 8.20 + 1 .12log( Ms/1011MâŠ™).(4)
 Hence, once Msis ï¬xed, we can calculate the potential
 from the BH with the mass of MBH.
 As mentioned in Section 1, the mass dependence of
 the inner stellar density proï¬le is discussed by a number
 of authors. The ï¬rst thorough study was carried out
 by the â€œNuker team,â€ who introduced the â€œNuker lawâ€
 to describe the observed surface brightness proï¬le of the
 central regions of galaxies. The Nuker law (Lauer et al.
 1995; Faber et al. 1997) is given by
 I(R) =Ib2(Î²âˆ’Î³)/Î±(R/R b)âˆ’Î³[1 + (R/R b)Î±](Î³âˆ’Î²)/Î±.(5)
 The asymptotic logarithmic slope inside RbisÎ³;
 the asymptotic logarithmic outer slope is Î²; and Î±
 parametrizes the sharpness of the break. The break ra-
 dius,Rb, is the point of maximum curvature in log-log
 coordinates. The break surface brightness, Ib, is the sur-
 face brightness at Rb. This function is designed to ï¬t the
 surface brightness proï¬le in the inner region, and not to
 describe the entire proï¬le. Graham et al. (2003) pro-
 posed a new formula that is a combination of an inner
 power-law proï¬le and an outer SÂ´ ersic law. They call it
 the â€œcore-SÂ´ ersic law,â€ which is described as
 I(R)=Iâ€²[1 + (Rb/R)Î±]Î³/Î±

 The parameter Rbis the break radius to separate the
 inner power law with a slope of Î³from the outer SÂ´ ersic
 law with eï¬€ective radius Reand index ns, and Ibis the
 surface brightness at Rb. The parameter Î±controls the
 sharpness of the transition between the inner and outer
 proï¬les, where a higher value leads to sharper transitions.
 Trujillo et al. (2004b) suggest that the core-SÂ´ ersic law
 can be simpliï¬ed with Î±â†’ âˆž and still provide a good
 description to the observed proï¬les (see also Ferrarese
 et al. 2006). In this limit,
 I(R)=Ib[(Rb/R)Î³u(Rbâˆ’R)
 +eb(Rb/Re)1/nseâˆ’b(R/Re)1/nsu(Râˆ’Rb)/bracketrightBig
 ,(8)
 where u(xâˆ’a) is the Heaviside step function.
 It is still controversial which of the two formalisms bet-
 ter describes the surface brightness proï¬le in the cen-
 tral region of galaxies (Ferrarese et al. 2006; Lauer et al.
 2007). In this paper, we adopt the core-SÂ´ ersic law simply
 for computational convenience to link the density proï¬les
 in the inner region to the total mass of the stellar bulge.
 Although the simpliï¬ed version of the core-SÂ´ ersic law as
 given in equation (8) has been adopted to ï¬t recent ob-
 servations (Trujillo et al. 2004b; Ferrarese et al. 2006),
 we use equation (6) by setting Î±to 5.0, for computa-
 tional convenience. Lauer et al. (2007) demonstrate how
 the sharp transition generated from equation (8) leads
 to poor ï¬ts to the observed surface brightness proï¬les.
 The adopted Î±provides a less sharp transition. This
 assumption also guarantees that the deprojected density
 proï¬le does not increase with radius with our adopted
 parameters (see below), but the proï¬les is still close to
 the simpliï¬ed formula of equation (8) used in the obser-
 vations.
 As a comparison between the Nuker law (eq. 5) and
 the core-SÂ´ ersic law (eq. 6), we brieï¬‚y mention how the
 logarithmic gradient, Î³â€²(Râ€²), at radius of Râ€²can be de-
 scribed for each ï¬tting function (see also Trujillo et al.
 2004b). Rest et al. (2001) show that for the Nuker law

 dlogR/bracketrightbigg
 Râ€²=Î³+Î²(Râ€²/Rb)Î±
 1 + (Râ€²/Rb)Î±.(9)
 For the core-SÂ´ ersic law (eq. 6), Trujillo et al. (2004b)
 show that the slope can be written as
 Î³â€²(Râ€²) =b
 ns(1/Re)1/nsRâ€²Î±(Râ€²Î±+RÎ±
 b)1/(nsÎ±)âˆ’1+Î³(Rb/Râ€²)Î±
 1 + (Rb/Râ€²)Î±.
 (10)
 The core-SÂ´ ersic law (eq. 6) is equivalent to the SÂ´ ersic
 law, when Rb= 0 and Î³= 0. Then, the SÂ´ ersic law is
 described as
 I(x)=Asexp(âˆ’bsx1/ns), (11)
 withx=R/R e. Prugniel & Simien (1997) derive the
 numerical solutions

 3+ 0.009876 /ns, (13)where Itotis the total bulge luminosity of the integration
 for 0â‰¤xâ‰¤ âˆž (see also Graham & Driver 2005, and
 references therein). For simplicity, we deï¬ne the total
 bulge mass, Ms, as the total mass of the integration of the
 SÂ´ ersic law of equation (11), regardless of the existence of
 the core. Then, assuming a constant mass-to-luminosity
 ratio Î¥ at the diï¬€erent radii, we can describe the surface
 brightness at the break radius, Ib, for the core-SÂ´ ersic law
 (eq. 6) as
 Ib=Ms

 It is well known that Reandnscorrelate with the to-
 tal luminosity of galaxies (e.g., Kormendy 1977; Caon
 et al. 1993; Graham 2002). From their ï¬ts of HSTim-
 ages of Virgo early-type galaxies using equation (8), Fer-
 rarese et al. (2006) ï¬nd that the proï¬les of bright galax-
 ies (MBâ‰¤ âˆ’20.5 mag) require a core, while those of
 less luminous galaxies can be described with the SÂ´ ersic
 law. They also derive the following relations between the
 g-band eï¬€ective radius and B-band absolute magnitude:
 logRe=âˆ’0.055(MB+ 18) + 1 .14 (15)
 for the SÂ´ ersic galaxies, and
 logRe=âˆ’0.22(MB+ 18) + 1 .5 (16)
 for the core-SÂ´ ersic galaxies (Ferrarese et al. 2006, for er ror
 estimates, see). The units of Reis arcseconds, which for
 Virgo corresponds to 1â€²â€²= 80.1 pc. In addition, they
 suggest that the SÂ´ ersic index nsand the B-band absolute
 magnitude are related by
 logns=âˆ’0.10(MB+ 18) + 0 .39, (17)
 valid for galaxies of both classes. In this paper we adopt
 these relations for computational convenience.
 We further assume that the stellar mass-to-light ra-
 tio for early-type galaxies in the B-band is Î¥ B=
 Ms/(LB/LB,âŠ™) = 7, with MB,âŠ™= 5.48 mag, and that
 Î¥Bis independent of mass; these assumptions are suf-
 ï¬ciently accurate for early-type galaxies (Trujillo et al.
 2004a). With some exceptions, Ferrarese et al. (2006)
 ï¬nd that there is a critical luminosity that separates
 the SÂ´ ersic galaxies from the core-SÂ´ ersic galaxies. With
 the assumptions made above, their critical luminosity of
 MB,c=âˆ’20.5 mag corresponds to Ms,c= 1.73Ã—1011
 MâŠ™; systems with masses lower than Ms,care assumed to
 follow the SÂ´ ersic law. Then, we derive the half-mass ra-
 dius using equations (15) and (16), with the assumption
 that the g-band half-light radius is similar to the half-
 mass radius. Once we ï¬x Ms, all the parameters of equa-
 tion (6) can be determined, and equation (6) provides
 the projected mass density proï¬le of Î£ s(R) =IB(R)Î¥B.
 Assuming spherical symmetry, we can derive the three-

 the host galaxy mass. In this section we study how the
 stability of CN disks with ï¬xed mass and radius depends
 on the total mass of the host galaxies. Here, we focus on
 a disk with mass log( Md/MâŠ™) = 8 and radius Rd= 2.5
 kpc, which is roughly the same as the CN disk observed
 in NGC 4476 by Young (2002). Disks with a range of
 diï¬€erent masses and radii will be discussed in the next
 section. Note that once MdandRdare ï¬xed, Î£ d(R)
 does not depend on Î±accorcs. Hence, Q(R) described
 by equation (1) is independent of Î±accand is simply pro-
 portional to cs=/radicalbig

 Âµ, and mpare the speciï¬c heat, Boltzmannâ€™s constant,

 the proton mass, respectively. Throughout the paper, we
 ï¬xedcsto a value corresponding to Âµ= 0.6,Î³d= 1, and
 Td= 30 K, which is a typical temperature of observed
 CN disks (e.g., Wiklind et al. 1995; Tran et al. 2001).
 Stability of the CN disk is examined for host galaxy
 models with stellar bulge masses of log( Ms/MâŠ™) = 10,
 11, and 12. We apply the SÂ´ ersic law to the model with
 log(Ms/MâŠ™) = 10 (model S10), and the core-SÂ´ ersic law
 to the model with log( Ms/MâŠ™) = 12 (model cS12). Since
 the adopted scaling relation used in Section 2 is known to
 have signiï¬cant scatter and the model of log( Ms/MâŠ™) =11 is close to the critical mass of Ms,c= 1.73Ã—1011MâŠ™
 for the two stellar density proï¬les, we consider two cases
 of the SÂ´ ersic (model S11) law and the core-SÂ´ ersic (model
 cS11) laws for host galaxies with log( Ms/MâŠ™) = 11. All
 the parameter values for the stellar density proï¬les and
 the estimated B-band absolute magnitude are summa-
 rized in Table 1. We choose Î³= 0.1 for the core-SÂ´ ersic
 law of equation (6), which is a relatively low value among
 observed cores (e.g., Ferrarese et al. 2006); this is a con-
 servative choice because it leads to a maximally unstable
 CN disk.
 Figure 1 shows that the stellar density proï¬le and the
 total mass of stars and BH as a function of radius for the
 four models. Comparison between models S11 and S10
 shows that the density proï¬le is steeper for higher mass
 galaxies, which have a larger ns. The core-SÂ´ ersic models
 lead to a lower density in the inner region. Consequently,
 model cS12 has even lower density than model S11 and
 a similar density to model S10 within the break radius of
 cS12. However, higher mass galaxies have a more massive
 BH. As a result, the total mass within a given radius
 is generally higher for the higher mass galaxies, except
 around the break radius for the core-SÂ´ ersic models.
 Figure 2 presents the values of Toomreâ€™s Q-parameter
 at diï¬€erent radii of the CN disk for the four models.
 We also examine two additional cases for each model;
 one is the case assuming no BH (dotted line), and the
 other one (dashed line) ignores the stellar potential (i.e. ,
 only the Keplerian potential of the BH is considered).
 As described in Section 2, the circular velocity (Fig. 3)
 is calculated purely by the BH and/or stellar potential,
 and the gas disk density proï¬le (Fig. 4) is derived from
 the condition of Ë™M(R) = constant in equation (3).
 The BH-only potential results (dashed lines) demon-
 strate that since higher mass galaxies have a more mas-
 sive BH, CN disks are more stable in higher mass galax-
 ies. However, for the assumed CN disk, even model cS12
 still has Q < 1â€”i.e., the CN disk is unstable. The
 stellar+BH potential results clearly demonstrate that
 the stellar potential greatly helps to stabilize the CN
 disk. Moreover, comparison between the results for the
 stellar+BH potential and the results of the case of stellar-
 only potential indicates that the BH helps to stabilize the
 CN disk only in the inner region (a few 100 pc, depending
 on the BH mass and the stellar density proï¬les). There-
 fore, the stellar potential cannot be ignored in studying
 the dynamics of the CN disk.
 For the SÂ´ ersic models, the stellar potential stabilizes
 the CN disk more in the higher mass galaxies, because
 higher mass galaxies have larger ns, i.e. higher central
 concentration of the stellar potential (see also Fig. 1). AtStability of Circumnuclear Disk in Ellipticals 5

 a ï¬xed stellar mass of log( Ms/MâŠ™) = 11 the core-SÂ´ ersic
 model leads to a lower Q-value and a more unstable disk.
 The surface density proï¬le of the CN disk is sensitive to
 this change of the stellar potential proï¬le (Fig. 4). The
 stellar-only potential results clearly demonstrate that t he
 disk gas density has a peak around the break radius. Due
 to this peak density, the Q-value becomes as low as the
 case of the BH-only potential. However, the BH can
 stabilize the disk in the inner region, and the stellar+BH
 potential case is much more stable. As a result, model
 cS11 is more stable than model S10.
 In general, CN disks in higher mass galaxies are more
 stabilized, due to higher mass BH and more centrally
 concentrated proï¬le of the stellar component. However,
 if the host galaxy has the core-SÂ´ ersic law proï¬le, the CN
 disk is more unstable, compared with the CN disk in
 a galaxy with the same stellar mass and BH mass, but
 having SÂ´ ersic proï¬le.Fig. 4.â€” The surface density proï¬le, Î£ d(R), of the CN disk with

 law and a core-SÂ´ ersic law, respectively (Ferrarese et al. 2 006; Lauer
 et al. 2007); open diamonds mark galaxies with unclassiï¬ed p roï¬les.

 3.2.Stability of CN Disks with Various Masses and
 Radii
 In this section, we again consider the four models
 shown in Table 1, but study the stability of the CN disks
 with diï¬€erent masses and radii. Figure 5 shows the Q-
 value for the CN disks with radii in the range of 0 .05âˆ’15
 kpc and masses spanning log( Md/MâŠ™) = 4âˆ’10. Here,
 the ï¬gure shows the minimum Q-value in each model.
 For example, Qminâ‰ˆ3.15 atrd= 380 pc for model cS12
 in Figure 2.6 Kawata, Cen, and Ho
 As expected, CN disks with higher gas mass and
 smaller radii are more unstable. Comparison between
 S10 and S11 demonstrates that for two CN disks with
 the same mass and radius in a SÂ´ ersic-law galaxy, the disk
 in the higher mass galaxy is always more stable, due to
 the higher mass BH and the more centrally concentrated
 stellar density proï¬le. If the CN disk is smaller than the
 break radius, the highest mass model (i.e. model cS12)
 is the most stable. For a CN disk with a size compara-
 ble to the break radius, model cS12 leads to a less stable
 condition than model S11, and for the larger CN disk
 model cS12 is as stable as model S11. Therefore, for
 large CN disks in high mass galaxies, the size of the disk
 with respect to the break radius of the host galaxies is
 an important factor for the stability.
 4.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
 Our analysis of the stability of CN disks reveals the
 following trends.
 (1) The CN disk is stabilized by the presence of the
 central BH. Since higher mass galaxies tend to have
 more massive BHs, the CN disk is more stable in
 higher mass galaxies in general.
 (2) The stellar potential is also important for the sta-
 bility of the CN disk.
 (3) For SÂ´ ersic-law galaxies, the CN disk is more stable
 in higher mass galaxies because they tend to have
 more centrally concentrated stellar density proï¬les.
 (4) The existence of a central stellar core in luminous
 ellipticals makes the CN disk unstable, especially
 around the break radius.
 As discussed in Section 2, the central surface bright-
 ness proï¬les for relatively low-mass galaxies ( Msâ‰¤1011
 MâŠ™) are generally described by the SÂ´ ersic law, with the
 trend of higher mass galaxies tending to have larger ns.
 Points (1)â€“(3) above indicate that CN disks in lower mass
 galaxies are more unstable. On the other hand, rela-
 tively high-mass galaxies (log( Ms/MâŠ™)â‰¥11) tend to
 have stellar density proï¬les that contain a central core,
 which leads to a more unstable CN disk compared to the
 SÂ´ ersic law. On the other hand, since such systems also
 have more massive BHs, CN disks in higher mass galax-
 ies are kept stable, especially within the break radius.
 These trends can explain the observational trends out-
 lined in Section 1. Because CN disks are more stable in
 more luminous ellipticals, this provides a natural expla-
 nation for central star formation to be curtailed in giant
 ellipticals, whereas less luminous ellipticals apparentl y
 have host nuclear star formation with greater ease, even
 though cold ISM in the form of dusty nuclear disks are
 observed to be just as prevalent in both environments.
 It is also worth stressing that, as seen in Figure 4, the
 CN disk can remain stable even if the density of the disk
 is more than 100 MâŠ™pcâˆ’2within 100 pc. This is because
 the BH stabilizes the CN disk in the central region, as
 seen in Figure 2. This density is much higher than the
 canonical density threshold for star formation suggested
 by both observations (Kennicutt 1989) and theory (e.g.,
 Schaye 2004), Î£ thâˆ¼3âˆ’10MâŠ™pcâˆ’2. Our stability
 analysis oï¬€ers a simple explanation for the lack of starformation (e.g., Okuda et al. 2005; Young 2005) in CN
 disks that otherwise have high densities.
 At a ï¬xed total stellar mass for the host galaxy, galax-
 ies with higher nsSÂ´ ersic law have more stable CN disks,
 while the core-SÂ´ ersic law leads to more unstable CN disks
 than the SÂ´ ersic law. Therefore, the frequency of central
 star formation activity should depend on both the cen-
 tral stellar density proï¬le as well as the BH mass. Re-
 cent near-ultraviolet observations performed with Galaxy
 Evolution Explorer (GALEX) indicate that some frac-
 tion of early-type galaxies have a small amount of recent
 star formation (Yi et al. 2005). Based on semi-analytic
 model predictions Schawinski et al. (2006) demonstrate
 that the observed near-ultraviolet color distributions of
 early-type galaxies can be explained if there is a criti-
 cal BH mass at the ï¬xed velocity dispersion for galaxies
 that have recent star formation. They suggested that the
 critical BH mass likely comes from strong AGN heating
 created by the massive BH (e.g., Binney & Tabor 1995;
 Silk & Rees 1998; Kawata & Gibson 2005; Springel et al.
 2005; Croton et al. 2006; Bower et al. 2006; Ciotti & Os-
 triker 2007). However, our study demonstrates that the
 existence of a critical condition for star formation at the
 ï¬xed velocity dispersion can be due to the stability of the
 CN disk, which is governed by both the stellar density
 proï¬le andthe BH mass.
 As mentioned in Section 1, the size and mass of the CN
 disk have been measured by several observational stud-
 ies. Some of these measurements are plotted in Figure
 5 to compare with our model predictions. The circles in
 Figure 5 correspond to objects whose CN disk mass and
 radius were estimated from CO emission observed with
 interferometers in Young (2002, 2005). Figure 5 also con-
 tains objects whose disk properties were estimated from
 the color excess of dust features measured in optical im-
 ages of the central region of early-type galaxies observed
 with the HST(Tomita et al. 2000)4. The stellar density
 proï¬les of the central region for the majority of the galax-
 ies in Tomita et al. (2000) have been studied by Ferrarese
 et al. (2006) and/or Lauer et al. (2007). This allows us
 to further distinguish the objects by their central proï¬le
 type.
 Following Section 2, we estimated the stellar mass
 from the B-band luminosity, assuming a stellar mass-
 to-light ratio of Î¥ B=Ms/(LB/LB,âŠ™) = 7. The B-band
 luminosities come from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic
 Database (NED). We plot the data for galaxies with
 masses log( Ms/MâŠ™)<10.5 and log( Ms/MâŠ™)>11.5 in
 the upper-left and lower-right panels of the ï¬gure, re-
 spectively; the rest of galaxies are shown in both the
 upper-right and lower-left panels.
 Only one objectâ€”NGC 4476â€” has been measured
 with both techniques (CO from Young (2002) and dust
 from Tomita et al. (2000)); the two data points are con-
 nected with the dotted line. Young (2002) obtained a
 much higher gas mass of 1 .1Ã—108MâŠ™within 2.4 kpc,
 compared with a mass of 1 .0Ã—107MâŠ™within 1.8 kpc
 in Tomita et al. (2000). The order-of-magnitude discrep-
 ancy in mass cannot be explained by the slightly diï¬€erent
 distances adopted by these authors (18 Mpc by Young
 4Tomita et al. (2000) ï¬nd that some galaxies in their sample
 have irregular dust morphology. Figure 5 only shows data for galax-
 ies whose dust morphology is classiï¬ed a disk.Stability of Circumnuclear Disk in Ellipticals 7
 (2002) and 16.8 Mpc by Tomita et al. (2000)). It is note-
 worthy that allof the CO-measured CN disks have sys-
 tematically larger disk masses than the dust-measured
 systems, suggesting that at least part of the discrepancy
 may be due to systematic errors in the estimated gas
 masses. Both sets of observations require a conversion
 factor to arrive at a gas mass. In the case of the CO
 observations, a standard Galactic CO-to-H 2conversion
 factor was adopted. The CO-to-H 2conversion factor,
 however, may be systematically lower in regions of high
 metallicity (Arimoto et al. 1996), as is the case in the cen-
 tral regions of massive galaxies, a suggestion supported
 by radiative transfer calculations in numerical simula-
 tions of CN disks (Wada & Tomisaka 2005). If this is
 the case, then the gas masses from Young (2002, 2005)
 are overestimated.
 A similar caveat applies to the gas masses estimated
 from the dust extinction, which assume a Galactic gas-
 to-dust mass ratio (Tomita et al. 2000). However, dust
 mass estimated from optical extinction should be consid-
 ered as lower limit to the true dust masses (Goudfrooij
 & de Jong 1995; Tran et al. 2001; Martel et al. 2004).
 For example, Goudfrooij & de Jong (1995) show that
 the dust masses derived from the far-infrared emission
 are roughly an order of magnitude higher than those es-
 timated from optical extinction alone. They argue that
 the optical extinction may underestimate the dust mass
 by about factor of 2 due to the assumption that the dust
 is in front of the stars (see also Martel et al. 2000, who
 claim that this eï¬€ect is more signiï¬cant). Goudfrooij &
 de Jong (1995) also discuss that the discrepancy in the
 estimated dust mass is mainly due to the presence of dif-
 fusely distributed dust, which cannot be seen as optical
 extinction. We note, however, that such a diï¬€use com-
 ponent is unlikely to be present as a rotating disk, as it
 is more likely to be supported by velocity dispersion. In
 any case, it seems plausible that the gas masses derived
 from the optical dust features may be an underestimate
 of the true gas mass, thereby narrowing the disagree-
 ment with the CO-based masses. Until more accurategas masses are available, it is diï¬ƒcult to draw more quan-
 titative comparisons between our model predictions and
 observations.
 It is clear from inspection of Figure 5 that once the
 mass of the CN disk becomes high enough, the disk will
 inevitably become unstable for star formation, one of the
 consequences of which may be to aid gas fueling to the
 AGN (Wada 2004). This type of situation is likely to
 be realized in the aftermath of a gas-rich major merger,
 whereby the large amount of the gas dissipated toward
 the center can generate a high-mass CN disk. High-
 resolution millimeter observations of luminous infrared
 galaxies indeed suggest that systems with larger cen-
 tral gas surface densities tend to either form stars with
 greater eï¬ƒciency or have a higher probability of hosting
 an AGN (Bryant & Scoville 1999).
 Finally, we speculate that star formation induced in an
 unstable CN disk may be directly related to the forma-
 tion of kinematically decoupled cores (KDCs) that are
 often seen in the centers of early-type galaxies (e.g., Ko-
 rmendy 1984; Bender 1988; Bender & Surma 1992; Caon
 et al. 2000). One of the intriguing clues regarding the ori-
 gin of KDCs is that large cores are always old (McDermid
 et al. 2006). If KDCs are a by-product of unstable CN
 disks, then large KDCs require large, massive CN disks,
 which probably can only be formed through major, gas-
 rich mergers, which are most prevalent at earlier epochs.
